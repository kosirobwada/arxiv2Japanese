It currently has at least\nthree unresolved core issues: (i) heavy reliance on label\nannotation and synthetic data — causing poor generaliza-\ntion on natural scenarios; (ii) heuristic/hand-craft disen-\ntangling constraints make it hard to adaptively achieve an\noptimal training trade-off; (iii) lacking reasonable evalua-\ntion metric, especially for the real label-free data. To ad-\ndress these challenges, we propose a Closed-Loop unsu-\npervised representation Disentanglement approach dubbed\nCL-Dis. Specifically, we use diffusion-based autoencoder\n(Diff-AE) as a backbone while resorting to β-VAE as a co-\npilot to extract semantically disentangled representations.\nThe strong generation ability of diffusion model and the\ngood disentanglement ability of VAE model are complemen-\ntary. To strengthen disentangling, VAE-latent distillation\nand diffusion-wise feedback are interconnected in a closed-\nloop system for a further mutual promotion. Then, a self-\nsupervised Navigation strategy is introduced to identify in-\nterpretable semantic directions in the disentangled latent\nspace. Finally, a new metric based on content tracking is\ndesigned to evaluate the disentanglement effect. Experi-\nments demonstrate the superiority of CL-Dis on applica-\ntions like real image manipulation and visual analysis.\n1. Introduction\nDisentangled representation learning (DRL) [31] learns the\nunderlying explainable factors behind the observed data,\nwhere the different latent factors correspond to different\nproperties, respectively. This matches the way humans per-\nceive this world that we understand an object from its var-\nious properties (e.g., shape, size, color, etc.) [2, 20, 21, 60,\n91]. Thus, DRL is thought to be one of the possible ways\nfor AI to understand the world fundamentally, thus achiev-\n(a)   VAE-based DRL \n(b)   GAN-based DRL\n(c)    Diffusion-based DRL\n(d)   our Closed-loop DRL\n𝐱\n𝐳\n𝐄𝐧𝐜\n𝒒𝝓(𝒛|𝒙)\n𝒑𝜽(𝒙|𝒛)\n𝐃𝐞𝐜\n𝐱′\nmin 𝑫(𝒒𝝓(𝒛)||𝒑(𝒛))\nInfer disentangled latent\n𝐧\n𝐳\n𝐆𝐞𝐧\n𝐱′\n𝐃𝐢𝐬\n𝐱\nNoise\n𝐄𝐧𝐜\n𝐳′\nReal/\nFake\nmin 𝑰(𝒛, 𝒛′)\nInfer disentangled latent\n𝐱𝟎\n𝐱𝐭\nAdd \nnoise\n𝐔𝐧𝐞𝐭\n𝐄𝐧𝐜\n𝐃𝐞𝐜\n𝐓\n𝐄𝐧𝐜\nො𝐱𝟎\nDiffusion process\nො𝐳\n𝐳′\nInfer disentangled latent by \nhand-craft variant-invariant loss\n𝐳\n𝐱𝟎\n′\n𝐱𝟎\n𝐱𝐭\nAdd \nnoise\n𝐔𝐧𝐞𝐭\n𝐄𝐧𝐜\n𝐃𝐞𝐜\n𝐓\nො𝐱𝟎\n𝐳\n𝐱𝟎\n′\nmin 𝑫(𝒒𝝓(𝒛)||𝒑(𝒛)) automatically\nInfer disentangled latent\nDistillation\nFeedback\nDiffusion \nprocess\nGaussian\nFigure 1. The illustration of disentangled representation learn-\ning (DRL) frameworks:\n(a) VAE-based, (b) GAN-based, (c)\nDiffusion-based, and (d) our proposed Closed-loop approach. We\ncan intuitively see that previous works all relied on heuristic hand-\ncraft loss constraints to infer disentangled latent, only our method\nleverages two kinds of generative branches to build a cycle system\nfor mutually-promoting automatically disentangled learning.\ning Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) [3, 49, 82].\nMost existing DRL methods learn the disentangled rep-\nresentation based on generative models, such as VAE [4, 7,\n18, 30, 42, 43, 45, 47, 69], GAN [8, 25, 36, 54, 77, 98], and\neven recently popular diffusion [48, 85, 86, 89, 94]. Among\nthem, the VAE-based DRL methods always encourage the\ndisentanglement of the latent variables by forcing the vari-\national posterior to be closer to the factorized Gaussian\nprior (see Figure 1(a)), but they generally need to balance\na hard inherent trade-off between the disentangling ability\nand generating quality [7, 30, 42]. As shown in Figure 1(b),\nthe GAN-based DRL methods tend to use the mutual in-\nformation as disentanglement constraints, but they typically\nsuffer from the problem of reconstruction quality due to the\ngan-inversion difficulty [81, 94]. Besides, VAE- and GAN-\narXiv:2402.02346v1  [cs.CV]  4 Feb 2024\nbased generative models are prone to learn the factorized or\nconditioned statistics bias [32], which essentially conflicts\nwith the ultimate purpose of a generalizable disentangle-\nment that makes AI understand the world like humans.\nMoreover, given the recently popular diffusion proba-\nbilistic models (DPMs) show superiority in image gener-\nation quality [33, 73] and unsupervised controlling (i.e.,\nlearning meaningful representations) of images [64], re-\nsearchers have started to investigate the possibility of DRL\nin DPMs. Asyrp [48] proposes an asymmetric reverse pro-\ncess to discover the semantic latent space in frozen pre-\ntrained diffusion models, which reveals that DPMs already\nhave a semantic latent space and thus more suitable for\nlearning disentangled semantics. The co-current work of\nDisDiff [94] shown in Figure 1(c) uses the gradient field of\nfrozen DPMs to achieve a vector-wise disentangled repre-\nsentation learning. However, this work applies an external\nheuristic hand-craft variant-invariant loss [57, 94] to enforce\nthe disentanglement processes, resulting in reduced model\nflexibility and posing challenges for optimization.\nIn this paper, we propose to leverage two kinds of gen-\nerative branches of the diffusion model and VAE model,\nto build a cycle system for mutually-promoting DRL.\nAs shown in Figure 1(d)), we construct an unsupervised\nClosed-Loop Disentanglement framework dubbed CL-Dis,\nwhich is built upon a diffusion-based autoencoder (Diff-\nAE) backbone while combining with a co-pilot of β-VAE,\nto together learn the meaningful disentangled representa-\ntions. To collaborate two branches well and facilitate fea-\nture disentangling, we encourage Diff-AE and β-VAE to\ncomplement each other, achieving a win-win effect: we\nuse the pre-trained latent of VAE to guide a semantic-aware\nreverse diffusion process with a distillation loss. Then, the\ngradually increasing information capability during the dif-\nfusion process is taken as feedback, in turn, to progressively\nenforce the inner latent of VAE more disentangling. Next, a\nself-supervised Navigation strategy is introduced to clearly\nidentify each factor’s semantic meanings, where shifting\nalong a disentangled semantic direction will result in con-\ntinuously changed generations. Finally, we further design\na label-free metric based on “changes tracking” to quan-\ntitatively measure the disentanglement of learned features,\nwherein we use optical flow to reflect image variation de-\ngree objectively. Our main contributions are summarized:\n• We build a new unsupervised representation disentan-\nglement framework CL-Dis, which has a mutually-\npromoting closed-loop architecture driven by diffusion\nand VAE models. They complement each other with a\ndistillation loss and a new feedback loss, and thus em-\npower a more controllable and stronger DRL capability.\n• We introduce a self-supervised method in CL-Dis to\nclearly identify each factor’s semantic meanings by navi-\ngating directions in the learned disentangled latent space,\nleading to coherent generated variations. This makes the\ngeneration more explainable and fine-controllable.\n• We design a new label-free metric to quantitatively mea-\nsure the interpretability and disentanglement of learned\nfeatures, and provide an example of immediate practical\nbenefit from our work. Namely, we experimentally show\nhow to exploit our CL-Dis for generative manipulation of\nreal images and visual discrimination tasks.\n2. Related Works\n2.1. Disentangled Representation Learning (DRL)\nThe concept of DRL was introduced by Bengio et al. [3] in\n2013 and was believed helpful in different tasks in practical\napplications like image generation [7, 8, 42, 43, 45, 47, 54,\n87], image editing/translation [24, 50, 56, 83], NLP [10,\n28, 84] and multimodal applications [34, 59, 78, 90, 97].\nDifferent from image generation or editing, the core of this\ntask is to fully understand the latent factors of the model to\nenhance its fine-grained controllability [7, 42, 43, 47, 87].\nMost VAE-based DRL approaches like β-VAE [30],\nDIP-VAE [47], FactorVAE [42], etc., achieve unsupervised\ndisentanglement by the direct constraints on probabilistic\ndistributions [7, 30, 42]. While straightforward, Locatello et\nal. [57] point out that is not enough and emphasize the need\nfor extra inductive bias. Similarly, Burgess [4] proposes to\nprogressively increase the information capacity of the latent\ncode in β-VAE. Yang et al. [92] use symmetry properties\nmodeled by group theory as inductive bias. Except for VAE,\nthere are also some DRL works based on GAN, e.g., lever-\naging mutual information [8], self-supervised contrastive\nregularizer [54], spatial constriction [98], and combining\nwith other pre-trained generative models [52, 66].\nFast-developing generative diffusion probabilistic mod-\nels (DPMs) have accelerated the DRL exploration. LCG-\nDM [44] uses a vanilla VAE in DPMs to extract semantics\ncodes for controllable generation, but ignores the interac-\ntion between these two structures.\nAsyrp [48] discovers\nthe semantic latent space in frozen pre-trained DPMs for\nimage manipulation. Co-current DisDiff [94] proposes a\nvector-wise method to express more information compared\nwith other scalar-based methods [4, 48, 54]. However, they\nuses gradient fields as an inductive bias at all time steps to\nachieve DRL, which relies on an external heuristic hand-\ncraft disentangling loss, lacking a self-driven learning abil-\nity and is hard to optimize. In contrast, our CL-Dis builds\na closed-loop DRL framework with a mutual-promoting\nmechanism driven by a two-branch complementary diffu-\nsion and β-VAE architecture, encouraging stronger disen-\ntangled feature auto-learning.\n2.2. Knowledge Distillation and Feature Feedback\nOur closed-loop CL-Dis is bridged by these two techniques.\nKnowledge distillation (KD) is originally developed for\nmodel compression and acceleration [11, 26, 80], or used\nin transfer learning [1, 38].\nFeature feedback [14, 15,\n41, 58, 63] enhances the robustness of learning systems\nby using explainable information, which is gaining more\nand more attention in AI alignment [37], RLHF [13, 46],\nand embodied AI [17, 67]. For instance, ControlVAE [69]\nachieves much better reconstruction quality with a variant\nof the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, using\nthe output KL-divergence as feedback. Following this idea,\nwe explore taking the strong generation capability of diffu-\nsion models as information-increasing feedback to automat-\nically and adaptively enhance disentangled feature learning.\n2.3. Latent Semantics Discovery (LSD)\nThis task emerges to move around the latent code (of\nGAN [12, 75, 79], Diffusion [48], etc), such that only one\nfactor varies during the traversal generation. They mostly\nrely on human annotations (i.e., segmentation masks, at-\ntribute categories, 3D priors, and text descriptions) to define\nthe semantic labels [9, 22, 53, 62, 71, 72]. Unsupervised\nLSD [70, 74, 79] often learn a set of directions or a classi-\nfier/matrix (e.g., Hessian, Jacobian regularization, etc.) to\nidentify latent semantics. Wu et al. [85] find semantics in\nthe stable diffusion model by partially changing the text em-\nbeddings. However, these methods are not strictly equiva-\nlent to DRL, most of them just rely on already disentangled\n(text) features to get coherent traversal generation results.\n3. Background and Motivation\n3.1. Understanding disentangling in β-VAE\nDue to the poor disentanglement of vanilla VAE on complex\ndata, β-VAE [30] adds explicit inductive bias to strengthen\nthe independence constraint of the variational posterior dis-\ntribution qϕ(z|x) with a β penalty coefficient in ELBO:\nL(θ, ϕ) =Eqϕ(z|x)\n\u0002\nlog pθ(x|z)\n\u0003\n− βDKL\n\u0000qϕ(z|x)∥pθ(z)\n\u0001\n,\n(1)\nwhen β=1, β-VAE degenerates to the original VAE, and\nlarger β encourages more disentangled representations but\nharms the performance of reconstruction. Unfortunately, it\nis practically intractable to obtain the optimal β to balance\nthe trade-off between reconstruction quality and the disen-\ntangling capability [7, 47]. Thus, Burgess et al. [4] under-\nstand β-VAE from the perspective of information bottleneck\ntheory, and propose improving disentangling in β-VAE with\ncontrolled information capacity increase:\nL(θ, ϕ) =Eqϕ(z|x) log pθ(x|z) − β\n\f\fDKL\n\u0000qϕ(z|x)∥pθ(z)\n\u0001\n− C\n\f\f,\n(2)\nwhere C gradually increases from 0 to a value large enough\nduring the training to guarantee the expressiveness of la-\ntent representations, thus improving disentangling. How-\never, such a hand-craft increasing strategy is hard to con-\ntrol and might hurt disentangling performance, especially\nfor various scenarios on different datasets. Thus, in our\nwork, we learn from this idea but upgrade it by exploiting\nthe essence of the Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) in\nautomatically increasing information capacity [51, 61] for\ndisentangling enhancement.\n3.2. DPM and Diffusion Autoencoder (Diff-AE)\nHere, we first take DDPM [33] as a vanilla DPM example\nfor illustration, which adopts a sequence of fixed variance\ndistributions q(xt|xt−1) as the noise-adding forward pro-\ncess to collapse the image distribution p(x0) to N(0, I):\nq(xt|xt−1) = N(xt;\np\n1 − βtxt−1, βtI).\n(3)\nThe reverse process is fitting by other distributions of θ, and\nit is a progressively increasing process of information ca-\npacity (i.e., entropy decreasing) as we mentioned before:\npθ(xt−1|xt) = N(xt; µθ(xt, t), σtI),\n(4)\nwhere µθ(xt, t) is parameterize by a Unet ϵθ(xt, t). Its opti-\nmization is to minimize the variational upper bound of neg-\native log-likelihood Lθ = Ex0,t,ϵ ∥ϵ − ϵθ(xt, t)∥.\nFurthermore, Diff-AE [64] is proposed for representa-\ntion learning based on DPM and Autoencoder. It uses a\nlearnable semantic encoder for discovering the high-level\nmeaningful semantics zsem = Esem(x0), and a DPM-\nbased decoder p(xt−1|xt, zsem) that is conditioned on\nzsem for reconstruction. However, the latent representa-\ntion zsem learned by Diff-AE does not explicitly respond to\nthe underlying factors of the data, or say, its disentangling\npotential has not been fully unleashed.\n4. Methodology: Closed-Loop DRL (CL-Dis)\nBased on the analysis above, we propose to leverage VAE\nand diffusion to unleash their strengths for a mutually pro-\nmoting DRL. As shown in Figure 2, our CL-Dis is a dual-\nbranch cycle framework, involving multiple iterative phases\nwith (a) diffusion autoencoder (Diff-AE), (b) β-VAE, and\nthe core (c) knowledge distillation & feature feedback pro-\ncess. In Section 4.1, we first present the formulation of\nclosed-loop DRL and the overview of CL-Dis. After that,\nwe introduce different phases of CL-Dis, including Diff-AE\npre-training, β-VAE pre-training, and knowledge distilla-\ntion & feature feedback in Section 4.2. Then, we propose a\nself-supervised Navigation strategy to identify disentangled\nsemantic meanings and a new well-designed DRL metric\n(Section 4.3) for the final disentanglement measurement.\n4.1.

Pipeline of the proposed CL-Dis. We explore using (a) diffusion-based autoencoder (Diff-AE) as a backbone while resorting\nto (b) β-VAE as a co-pilot via knowledge distillation to help Esem extract a semantic disentangled representation zsem of an input image\nx0 (which is taken as condition for diffusion-based generation). To further facilitate feature disentangling, we further take (c) the reverse\ndiffusion process as an increasing information capacity indicator feedback to, in turn, enhance the disentanglement of feature zdisen in\nβ-VAE. As a result, Diff-AE and β-VAE are interconnected as a closed-loop cycle system with VAE-latent distillation and diffusion-wise\nfeedback controlling, achieving a win-win effect and well-disentangled fine-controllable representation learning.\nour CL-Dis is to learn a semantic encoder Esem, for each\nfactor c ∈ C, when varying its latent value, its reconstructed\ngeneration results will have the corresponding changes.\nIn Figure 2, our CL-Dis takes Diff-AE as the back-\nbone, which has exactly a semantic encoder Esem to en-\ncode the raw data x0 into the semantic representations\nzsem for conditioning the diffusion reverse distributions\np(xt−1|xt, zsem). To empower Esem disentangling capa-\nbility, we additionally construct a β-VAE as co-pilot to\nhelp zsem become a semantic disentangled representation.\nGiven a dataset X from a distribution pdata(x), a stan-\ndard β-VAE framework [30] is built and ϕ, θ parametrize\nthe VAE encoder qϕ(z|x) and the decoder pθ(x|z), respec-\ntively. The prior p(z) is typically set to the isotropic unit\nGaussian N(0, 1), using a differentiable “reparametrization\ntrick (z = µ+σ)” [45]. With the objective of Eq. 1, we get a\npreliminary disentangled representations zdisen. Then, we\nuse a distillation loss Ldt to transfer such disentangling ca-\npability to the semantic latent zsem of Diff-AE,\nLdt = DKL\n\u0000zsem ∥ zdisen\n\u0001\n=\nX\nzsem · log( zsem\nzdisen ), (5)\nAs discussed before, gradually increasing the information\ncapacity of the VAE latent with a controlled way could im-\nprove disentangling [4]. The reverse diffusion process of\nDiff-AE (Eq. 4) is exactly a procedure of information capa-\nbility increasing. Thus, we take it as an indicator (see Fig-\nure 2(c)) in turn to enhance β-VAE disentangling by adap-\ntively adjusting the objective of Eq. 2, where we change the\nhand-craft C to a variable that can automatically change in\nthe optimization (Eq. 8). Such a mutually promoting mech-\nanism forms a closed-loop optimization flow.\n4.2. Training of the Whole CL-Dis Framework\n4.2.1\nPhase-1: Diff-AE and β-VAE Pre-training\nFollowing [64], the entire Diff-AE model is pre-trained on\nthe various datasets [39, 40, 96] to cover more semantic fac-\ntors in the latent space of zsem. But at this phase, zsem is\nstill far from well-disentangled, which is just taken as a kind\nof coarse condition for guiding diffusion generation [94].\nMoreover, the co-pilot β-VAE is also pre-trained on the\ncorresponding datasets (i.e., if Diff-AE was trained on the\nfacial data, β-VAE did the same), following the objective\nof Eq. 1, its latent zdisen has already enabled a preliminary\ndisentangling capability, i.e., can distinguish facial features\nof smile, azimuth, hair color, etc (Figure 2) to some degree.\n4.2.2\nPhase-2: Knowledge Distillation & Diffusion Feedback\nTo transfer the preliminary disentangling capability of\nzdisen into zsem, we use a distillation loss shown in Eq. 5\nto smoothly bridge Diff-AE and β-VAE. But this interaction\nis currently one-way, which is still limited by the intrinsic\nshortcomings of β-VAE discussed after Eq. 1 that it is hard\nto balance a trade-off and thus hurt the final performance.\nTherefore, we propose a novel diffusion feedback-driven\nloss Lfd to further facilitate the disentanglement of the rep-\nresentations (zdisen, zsem) and break the optimization bot-\ntleneck of the entire CL-Dis framework. Basically, inspired\nby the work of understanding β-VAE [4] that modified the\nvanilla objective by adding a hand-craft increasing con-\ntroller C (as shown in Eq. 2), we propose to leverage the\nreverse diffusion of Diff-AE that adaptively increases infor-\nmation capacity to build constraints to replace the original\nformat. Formally, we make the original C auto-changeable,\nand control its value dynamically according to the informa-\ntion capacity of the reverse diffusion process as follows:\nCdyn = f(Ext) =\n(\nCbase · (\nEx0\nExt ),\nif 0 < f(Ext) < Cmax\nCmax,\nif f(Ext) ≥ Cmax\n(6)\nEx0 = −\nX\npx0 ∈R\npx0logpx0,\nExt = −\nX\npxt ∈R\npxtlogpxt,\n(7)\nwhere Ex0 and Ext denote the information entropy of the\nstatic target image (i.e., Ground Truth) x0 and the inter-\nmediate predicted diffusion denoising image result xt, re-\nspectively.\nThe probability values of px0, pxt are calcu-\nlated by flattening and probabilizing the values of the im-\nage matrices across the dimension of RC×H×W . Besides,\nCbase, Cmax are the original empirical start-point and the\nmaximum upper-bound according to [4], and their influ-\nences are studied in supplementary. We can intuitively see\nthat with the denoising diffusion processing, the entropy\nExt of the predicted image result xt will gradually drop\n(i.e., information capacity increasing), and thus the ratio of\nEx0\nExt will increase to raise the influence of Cdyn. So, the ob-\njective of β-VAE changes from Eq. 2 to the following Lfd,\nLfd(θ, ϕ, Cdyn; x, z) =Eqϕ(z|x) log pθ(x|z)−\nβ\n\f\fDKL\n\u0000qϕ(z|x)∥pθ(z)\n\u0001\n− Cdyn\n\f\f,\n(8)\nthe above physical meaning is that: when KL-divergence\ndrops to a certain extent (i.e., disentangling ability encoun-\nters bottleneck in a naive VAE latent), the dynamic con-\ntroller Cdyn will counteract this change by increasing the\nvalue of the second item of Eq. 8. Intuitively, Cdyn that\nis controlled by diffusion feedback gradually highlights the\npenalty for KL-divergence, thus improving the latent disen-\ntangling. Under this closed-loop optimization flow (see Fig-\nure 2(c)), the gradually increasing information capacity of\ndiffusion adaptively enhances the disentanglement of latent\nzdisen, so as to further benefit the semantic code of zsem.\nPlease see supplementary for more theoretical analysis.\n4.2.3\nPhase-3: Semantics Directions Navigation\nAfter getting the well-disentangled representations of zsem,\nthe next step is to identify its semantic meanings. Shifting a\nDiff-AE\nGenerator\nShifter\n𝑀(𝜅, 𝛿)\nWell-disentangled 𝐳𝐬𝐞𝐦\n𝐳𝐬𝐞𝐦\n′\n= 𝐳𝐬𝐞𝐦+ 𝑀(𝜅, 𝛿)\nShift\nPredictor\n𝑃\n𝜅, 𝛿\n𝜅′, 𝛿′\nShifting a dimension of 𝒛𝒔𝒆𝒎 causes \nonly one factor (i.e., eyes) changes.\nFigure 3.\nA self-supervised Navigation strategy is to discover\nthe interpretable shifts in the well-disentangled space of zsem. A\ntraining sample consists of two images, produced by the Diff-AE\nwith original and shifted inputs. The images are given to a predic-\ntor P that predicts the direction index k and shift magnitude δ.\ncertain dimension of the well-disentangled condition zsem\nwill result in a generated result that only the corresponding\nproperty/factor changes. Thus, we adopt an outer naviga-\ntion branch to identify the traversal directions in a global\nview. Specifically, we employ a learnable matrix M (see\nFigure 3) to manually append a shift on zsem. The shifted\ncode z′\nsem, together with the original zsem, is fed into our\nDiff-AE decoder to generate a pair of images, following the\nreverse conditional diffusion process of p(xt−1|xt, zsem).\nA learnable predictor P is then devised to predict the shift\n(i.e., semantic direction) according to such generated paired\nimages, with a reconstruction loss. In this way, we clearly\nidentify the inner disentangled semantics directions in our\nCL-Dis for further fine-controllable generations.\n4.3. New Disentanglement Metric\nThe conditional diffusion-based generation in our CL-Dis\ndefines a clear mapping between the disentangled represen-\ntations and the generated image results, so we can quantita-\ntively measure the performance of disentanglement with the\ngeneration difference. Following this idea, we quantify this\ndifference by using an optical flow tracking technique [76]:\nGiven a well-disentangled representation za\nsem and its shift\nvariant za′\nsem, we calculate the optical flow map F between\ntheir corresponding generated images. Then, we use a con-\ntinuously changed hyper-parameter as a dynamic threshold\nto distinguish these “changed characteristics” caused by\nshifted factors from the rest “frozen ones”. The average ra-\ntio of these two parts actually reflects the disentanglement\nperformance, the smaller the better. Due to the space limi-\ntations, more operation details are in supplementary.\n5. Experiment\n5.1. Implementation Detail and Experiment Setting\nFor the backbone of Diff-AE, we take pre-trained weights\nin [64] as the initial parameters with Adam optimizer and\nthe learning rate of 1e-4.\nFor the co-pilot β-VAE, we\nadopt the same Adam optimizer and learning rate.\nFor\nthe navigation branch, we refer to the GAN-based editing\nmethods [12, 79] for a fine-controllable generation. Dif-\nferently, our CL-Dis has already in advance got the well-\ndisentangled latent zsem. The whole CL-Dis framework is\ntrained on 2 NVIDIA V100 GPUs with a batch size of 32.\nIn inference, the co-pilot β-VAE is discarded for efficiency.\nThe dimension of zsem is set to 512 in our framework. To\nevaluate disentanglement, we conduct experiments on both\ngeneration & perception tasks, on synthetic & real data.\nDatasets & Baselines. For the image generation task, we\nconduct experiments on FFHQ [40], CelebA [39], LSUN\nHorse [96], LSUN Cars [96], Shape3D [42]. We compare\nour proposed CL-Dis with VAE-based, GAN-based, and\nDiffusion-based baselines, including β-VAE [30], Factor-\nVAE [42], Beta-TCVAE [7], GAN Edit v1 [79], GAN Edit\nv2 [12], InfoGAN-CR [54], Asyrp [48], GANspace (GS)\n[27], NaviNeRF [88], DisCo [66], Diff-AE [64] and vector-\nbased DisDiff [94].\nFor the perception task, we just choose the classic face\nrecognition for instantiation due to limited space and con-\nduct experiments on CASIA-Webface [95] and VGGFace2\n[5] in comparison with the baseline of LFW [35].\nEvaluation Metrics. To alleviate errors, we have multiple\nruns for each method. We use 4 representative metrics of\nFactor-VAE score [42], DCI [19], FID [29] and classifica-\ntion accuracy in face recognition, and our additionally pro-\nposed new metric for validation. Note that our CL-Dis be-\nlongs to dimension-/scalar-based DRL methods, so we just\ndiscuss but do not directly compare with many vector-based\nones [6, 16, 55, 77, 93] in the next experiment sections.\n5.2.

And, our\nscalar-based disentangled representations are more light,\ngeneric, robust, and easy to apply to different scenarios.\nQualitative Results. Unlike most previous papers that only\ntest on the toy synthetic datasets [7, 30, 42], our CL-Dis\ncan be naturally applied to real images. Figure 4 shows the\neffectiveness of our method on various datasets. To clearly\nshow the isolated and “disentangled” effects, we use red cir-\ncles to mark the corresponding changed regions. We can ob-\nserve that CL-Dis can disentangle and change the isolated\nattributes continuously in an unsupervised manner, such as\nserious expression → smile, closing eyes → opening eyes,\nw/o earrings → w/ earrings, etc.\nMoreover, to validate the superiority of CL-Dis in the\ndisentanglement capability, Figure 5 also provides results\nfor changing human facial attributes to different character-\nOurs\nGAN Edit v1 \nAsyrp\nGAN Edit v2\nMouth\nOurs\nGAN Edit v1\nAsyrp\nGAN Edit v2\nEyes\nOurs\nGAN Edit v1 \nAsyrp\nGAN Edit v2\nHair\nFigure 5.

We can see\nthat other methods like Asyrp are prone to generate arti-\nfacts (bottom row of Figure 5), and their editing results are\nnot well-disentangled. For example, the whole face content\nhas changed for the schemes of GAN Edit v1 [79] and GAN\nEdit v2 [12]). In contrast, our method consistently keeps\nthe identity while just changing the disentangled properties,\nachieving an “isolated and disentangled” effect.\nTo demonstrate the generalization ability of our CL-\nDis, we also use different datasets and different backbones\n(supplementary) for validation.\nAs shown in Figure 6,\neven for cars, horses, and buildings, CL-Dis still obtains\na group of fine-grained disentanglement results, where only\nthe “color” attribute changes across the traversal direction,\nproving the disentanglement generalization capability.\nFigure 6. Generalization evaluation on extensive datasets. We vi-\nsualize the results of shifting the latent zsem with our proposed\nmethod along the common “Color” direction on LSUN Horse\n(upper row), LSUN Cars (middle row), and CelebA (lower row)\ndatasets, respectively.\n5.3. Ablation Study and More Analysis\nEffectiveness of Different Elements. To analyze the ef-\nfectiveness of the proposed parts in our closed-loop disen-\ntanglement framework, we perform an ablation to study the\ninfluence of Semantics Navigation, Knowledge Distillation\nLdt, and Diffusion Feedback Lfd. We take FFHQ as the\ndataset to conduct these ablation studies.\nAs shown in Figure 7, due to the baseline of Diff-AE it-\nself not having a disentanglement ability, when shifting its\nlatent we get generation results with background artifacts.\nIf we directly apply the semantics navigation [79] to the\nbaseline latent, the generation quality has been improved,\nbut the disentanglement is still not guaranteed. For exam-\nple, when shifting along the semantic direction of “Hair”\n(The 1st row of Figure 7), global features such as face\nshape, skin texture, and hairstyle are variously entangled,\nresulting in a younger appearance for the man. The last\ntwo schemes of adding knowledge distillation and diffusion\nfeedback have achieved better performance in disentangle-\nment, particularly for the final closed-loop scheme. We can\nsee that the final scheme together with Ldt & Lfd achieves\na better disentanglement effect on the semantic direction of\n“Hair”, compared to that only with Ldt which still changes\nface characteristics in the traversal generations.\nAnalysis of Auto-Driven Feedback Mechanism. As in-\ntroduced, the core contribution of this work lies in an auto-\nmatically disentangled learning mechanism, achieved by a\ndynamic Cdyn whose value depends on the increasing infor-\nmation capacity in the reverse diffusion process. To prove\nthat, we visualize the changing curves of Cdyn during the\nCL-Dis training. As illustrated in Figure 8(a), the value of\nCdyn gradually increases with the diffusion feedback, so\nas to highlight the penalty for KL-divergence item in the\nco-pilot β-VAE optimization and thus improve disentangle-\nment performance of the entire framework.\n5.4.

The core of this task is to fully un-\nderstand the latent factors of the model to enhance its fine-\ngrained controllability. The qualitative results shown above\nhave illustrated that traversing along the disentangled rep-\nresentations results in an “property isolated” generation ef-\nfect. To measure such effect quantitatively and show our\nmethod could progressively change the disentangled prop-\nerties while keeping others frozen, we propose a new metric\n(Sec. 4.3) through the lens of optical flow [76]. As illus-\ntrated in Figure 9, the optical flow visualization between\nthe original and shifted image pairs on FFHQ dataset [40],\nshows that our proposed CL-Dis method demonstrates ef-\nfective disentanglement, where shifting a single dimension\nof the latent space results in isolated property changes in the\ngenerated output. In contrast, the baseline approach (origi-\nnal Diff-AE) changes the entire background content of the\nimage.\nFurthermore, we perform normalization on the optical\nflow map and utilize a dynamic threshold to classify pixels\nas either exceeding or not exceeding it, thereby obtaining\nthe ratio. We make statistics based on the 100 sets, and cal-\nculate the average ratio using a static threshold of 0.5, and\nget the average value. The baseline quantitatively achieves\n0.1606 in this new metric, while our method is only 0.0177\n(the lower the better), indicating that our method has bet-\nter disentanglement performance that only isolated property\nOurs\nBaseline\nOriginal\nImage\nShifted\nImage\nOptical\nFlow\nFigure 9.

To illustrate that the navigation\nalong the semantic directions results in an isolated and “dis-\nentangled” effect, for a particular direction, we compute the\nper-pixel differences averaged over the generation results\nwith 20 shift magnitudes from a uniform grid in a range.\nFigure 8(b) shows the averaged heatmap for the “Eyes” and\n“Mouth” directions. We can see that our method achieves\na good disentanglement, where shifting “Eyes” just affects\nthe eyes-related image content, and shifting “Mouth” just\naffects the mouth-related image content.\nDiscrimination Task Validation. To validate whether the\ngood disentanglement achieved by our CL-Dis could bene-\nfit the discrimination task, we conducted face recognition\nexperiments on two large well-known datasets, CASIA-\nWebface [95] and VGGFace2 [5]. We use the semantics\nencoder Esem of CL-Dis as an off-the-shelf feature extrac-\ntor and introduce two additional learnable linear layers for\nfine-tuning. Following the same protocol used in [68], we\nperform a fair comparison in Table 4 with mean classifi-\ncation accuracy as a metric. We observe that the seman-\ntic encoder of our CL-Dis performs better than the baseline\nof learning from scratch (LFS) on the widely adopted test\nbenchmark LFW [35], and even our Esem trained with only\n5 epochs still outperforms the LFS model with 50 epochs,\nwhich demonstrates that the well-disentangled representa-\ntions learned by CL-Dis indeed benefit discrimination tasks.\nTable 4.

Conclusion\nIn this paper, we present CL-Dis, an unsupervised closed-\nloop disentanglement framework that achieves a strong\nDRL ability without relying on heavy supervision or heuris-\ntic loss constraints. CL-Dis embeds a closed-loop inter-\nconnection, where a pre-trained β-VAE empowers a pre-\nliminary disentanglement ability to diffusion model with a\ndistillation loss, while the increasing information capabil-\nity in the diffusion is taken as feedback, in turn, to pro-\ngressively improve β-VAE disentangling, forming a core\nmutually-promoting mechanism. Besides, we also design\na self-supervised strategy to navigate semantic directions in\nthe well-disentangled latent for a controllable generation.\nA new metric is further introduced to measure the disentan-\nglement effect. Experimental results indicate that CL-Dis\nachieves a state-of-the-art DRL performance, and its strong\ndisentangled ability benefits both generation and discrimi-\nnation tasks, especially on real-world images.\nSupplementary Material\nA. Understanding the effects of our CL-Dis\nConstrained optimization is important for enabling deep un-\nsupervised models to learn disentangled representations of\nthe independent data generative factors [30]:\n(1) In the β-VAE framework, this corresponds to tuning\nthe β coefficient in Eq. 1 as follows,\nL(θ, ϕ, x, z, β) =Eqϕ(z|x)\n\u0002\nlog pθ(x|z)\n\u0003\n−\nβDKL\n\u0000qϕ(z|x)∥pθ(z)\n\u0001\n,\n(9)\nβ can be taken as a mixing coefficient for balancing the\nmagnitudes of gradients from the reconstruction and the\nprior-matching components of the VAE lower bound for-\nmulation during training. When β is too low or too high the\nmodel learns an entangled latent representation due to either\ntoo much or too little capacity in the latent bottleneck [30].\n(2) In the understanding β-VAE version with a controlled\ncapacity increase strategy [4], this constrained optimization\ncorresponds to tuning the C coefficient in Eq 2 as follows,\nL(θ, ϕ, C; x, z) =Eqϕ(z|x) log pθ(x|z)−\nβ\n\f\fDKL\n\u0000qϕ(z|x)∥pθ(z)\n\u0001\n− C\n\f\f,\n(10)\nwhere the model is trained to reconstruct the images with\nsamples from the factor distribution, but with a range of\ndifferent target encoding capacities by pressuring the KL\ndivergence to be at a controllable value, C. The training ob-\njective combined maximizing the log-likelihood and mini-\nmizing the absolute deviation from C by linearly increasing\nit from a low value to a high value over the course of train-\ning. The intuitive picture behind C is that it gradually adds\nmore latent encoding capacity, enabling progressively more\nfactors of variation to be represented while retaining disen-\ntangling in previously learned factors.\n(3) In the proposed closed-loop unsupervised represen-\ntation disentanglement framework CL-Dis, this constrained\noptimization is totally automatic and dynamic-adaptive.\nThis is achieved under the mutual driving of reverse diffu-\nsion of Diff-AE and VAE latent evolution. We make the\nconstant C in\n[4] become changeable Cdyn, controlling\nits value dynamically according to the information capac-\nity variation in the reverse diffusion process as follows,\nLfd(θ, ϕ, Cdyn; x, z) = Eqϕ(z|x) log pθ(x|z)−\nβ\n\f\fDKL\n\u0000qϕ(z|x)∥pθ(z)\n\u0001\n− Cdyn\n\f\f,\n(11)\nCdyn ∝ I(x0; xt) =\nX X\np(x0, xt) · log\n\u0012\np(x0, xt)\np(x0) · p(xt)\n\u0013\n(12)\ns.t.\npθ′(xt−1|xt) = N(xt; µθ′(xt, t), σtI),\n(13)\nwhere the Cdyn is proportional to the information capabil-\nity of the reverse process in diffusion (here we use the mu-\ntual information I(x0; xt) to represent its value), which is\nparameterized by θ′ with a U-Net architecture and is a pro-\ngressively increasing process of information capacity (i.e.,\nentropy decreasing). Continuing this intuitive picture, we\ncan imagine that with the capacity of the information capa-\nbility gradually increasing in the reverse diffusion, the dy-\nnamic Cdyn would continue to utilize those extra indicators\nfor an increasingly precise encoding, where a larger im-\nprovement can be obtained by disentangling different fac-\ntors of variations in the latent.\nB. Implementation Details of the New Metric\nTo measure the disentanglement effect quantitatively, espe-\ncially under the unsupervised setting where no factor anno-\ntations are accessible, we propose a new label-free metric\nwith the help of optical flow [76]. The high-level idea is\nthat we leverage optical flow to track the obviously and con-\ntinually changed content to evaluate whether or not these\nchanges are “property isolated”. First, we calculate the op-\ntical flow between the original image and the shifted image.\nThen, we normalize the values of the optical flow map. Af-\nter that, we apply a threshold to the optical flow. Points\nin the flow exceeding this threshold are considered to have\na large shift magnitude (i.e., those disentangled attribute\npoints), while those below it are considered to have a small\nshift magnitude (i.e., those rest frozen attribute points). We\ncalculate the ratio of the number of flow points exceeding\nthis threshold to those below it and use this ratio value as\nour new metric score. The lower the better, and which ex-\nactly corresponds to the definition of disentangled represen-\ntations where a change in a single unit of the representation\ncorresponds to a change in a single factor of variation of the\ndata while being invariant to others. The specific algorithm\nis shown in Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2. Empirically and\nexperimentally, we set the threshold as 0.5 for the calcula-\ntion of the proposed new metric.\nAlgorithm 1 Compute New Metric Based on Optical Flow\n1: function\nCOMPUTENEWMETRIC(image,\nshifted image, threshold)\n2:\nflow ← OPTICALFLOW(image, shifted image)\n3:\nnormalized flow ← NORM(flow)\n4:\nlarge shift count L ← 0\n5:\nsmall shift count S ← 0\n6:\nfor all flow point in normalized flow do\n7:\nif MAGNITUDE(flow point)\n>\nthreshold\nthen\n8:\nL ← L + 1\n9:\nelse\n10:\nS ← S + 1\n11:\nend if\n12:\nend for\n13:\nmetric score ← L/S\n14:\nreturn metric score\n15: end function\nAlgorithm 2 Optical Flow Normalization\n1: function NORM(flow)\n2:\nmax norm ← MAX(\npP flow2)\n3:\nnormalized flow ← flow/max norm\n4:\nreturn normalized flow\n5: end function\nTable 5.

Comparisons of disentanglement on the FactorVAE score\nand DCI disentanglement metrics (mean ± std, higher is better).\nWe can see that our scalar-based CL-Dis even achieves compa-\nrable results with the co-current factor-based vector-wise DisD-\niff [94].\nMethod\nShapes3D\nFactorVAE score\nDCI\nVAE-based:\nFactorVAE [42]\n0.840 ± 0.066\n0.611 ± 0.082\nβ-TCVAE [7]\n0.873 ± 0.074\n0.613 ± 0.114\nGAN-based:\nInfoGAN-CR [54]\n0.587 ± 0.058\n0.478 ± 0.055\nPre-trained\nGAN-based:\nGAN Edit v1 [79]\n0.805 ± 0.064\n0.380 ± 0.062\nGANspace [27]\n0.788 ± 0.091\n0.284 ± 0.034\nDisCo [66]\n0.877 ± 0.031\n0.708 ± 0.048\nDiffusion-based:\nDisDiff [94]\n0.902 ± 0.043\n0.723 ± 0.013\nCL-Dis (Ours)\n0.952 ± 0.017\n0.731 ± 0.045\nCdyn = f(Ext) =\n(\nCbase · (\nEx0\nExt ),\nif 0 < f(Ext) < Cmax\nCmax,\nif f(Ext) ≥ Cmax\n(14)\nEx0 = −\nX\npx0 ∈R\npx0logpx0,\nExt = −\nX\npxt ∈R\npxtlogpxt,\n(15)\nwhere Cbase, Cmax are the original empirical start-point\nand the maximum upper-bound according to [4], and their\ninfluences are evaluated as follows. The results depicted\nin Table 5 demonstrate that our method is robust enough\nto achieve a stable satisfactory performance with different\nvalues of Cbase, Cmax.\nBesides, these experimental re-\nsults reveal that setting Cbase to 10 consistently yields opti-\nmal disentanglement outcomes. Moreover, our assessment\nalso extends to examining the impact of the upper-bound\nvalue, Cmax. As shown in Table 5, reducing the gap be-\ntween Cmax and Cbase hampers the overall disentangle-\nment performance (0.794 vs. 0.762 in FactorVAE score).\nWe analyze that, the variable scope of the dynamic Cdyn\nwill be limited due to the relatively small range between\nCmax and Cbase. This limitation may negatively impact\nthe control of KL-divergence, consequently hampering the\noverall model’s ability to effectively disentangle the inner\nlatent space more.\nC.2. More Subjective Results\nIn this section, we further provide more visualization results\nto demonstrate the generalization ability of our CL-Dis on\ndifferent datasets, including FFHQ [40], LSUN Cars [96]\nand CelebA [39].\nAs shown in Figure 10, our CL-Dis\ncould generate fine-grained disentangled results along the\n“glasses, mouth, hair, car color, hair color, and face illu-\nmination” attribute changes across the traversal direction,\nwhich fully illustrates the well-generalized disentanglement\ncapability of our method.\nC.3.

Limitation Discussions\nIn Table 6 (corresponds to Table 2 in the main manuscript),\nwe observe our method encounters an unsatisfactory\nperformance on the MPI3D dataset, which indicates that\nour method may be distracted by the real-world natural\nenvironment scenarios. We discuss the potential reason that\nthe collected data in MPI3D [23], focus on bridging the\ngap between simulation and reality, which distinguishes\nit apart from various other synthetic toy datasets [42, 65].\nIn detail,\nreal-world recordings in MPI3D introduce\nmore extra environment interruptions, such as chromatic\naberrations in cameras and complex surface properties\nof objects (e.g., reflectance, radiance, and irradiance).\nThese interruptions pose challenges in learning disen-\ntangled representations due to the mixing of factors and\ndistortions during the real-world recordings, especially\nfor scalar-based methods like ours [23].\nThis unsolved\nlimitation of our method will be left as future research work.\nReferences\n[1] Sungsoo Ahn, Shell Xu Hu, Andreas Damianou, Neil D\nLawrence, and Zhenwen Dai.
