Millar2, Arcot Sowmya1, and Erik Meijering1,* 1School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia 2Department of Anatomical Pathology, NSW Health Pathology, St. George Hospital *Correspondence: erik.meijering@unsw.edu.au Abstract Breast cancer is a significant health concern affecting millions of women worldwide. Accurate survival risk stratification plays a crucial role in guiding personalised treatment decisions and improving patient outcomes. Here we present BioFusionNet, a deep learning framework that fuses image-derived features with genetic and clinical data to achieve a holistic patient profile and perform survival risk stratification of ER+ breast cancer patients. We employ multiple self- supervised feature extractors, namely DINO and MoCoV3, pretrained on histopathology patches to capture detailed histopathological image features. We then utilise a variational autoencoder (VAE) to fuse these features, and harness the latent space of the VAE to feed into a self-attention network, generating patient-level features. Next, we develop a co-dual-cross-attention mechanism to combine the histopathological features with genetic data, enabling the model to capture the interplay between them. Additionally, clinical data is incorporated using a feed-forward network (FFN), further enhancing predictive performance and achieving comprehensive multimodal feature integration. Furthermore, we introduce a weighted Cox loss function, specifically designed to handle imbalanced survival data, which is a common challenge in the field. The proposed model achieves a mean concordance index (C-index) of 0.77 and a time-dependent area under the curve (AUC) of 0.84, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. It predicts risk (high versus low) with prognostic significance for overall survival (OS) in univariate analysis (HR=2.99, 95% CI: 1.88–4.78, p<0.005), and maintains independent significance in multivariate analysis incorporating standard clinicopathological variables (HR=2.91, 95% CI: 1.80–4.68, p<0.005). The proposed multifeature and multimodal data fusion approach not only improves model performance but also addresses a critical gap in handling imbalanced data. This advancement has the potential to substantially influence therapeutic decision-making, leading to improved clinical outcomes for patients. Keywords Multimodal Fusion · Breast Cancer · Whole Slide Images · Deep Neural Network · Survival Prediction 1 Introduction Breast cancer poses a significant global health concern, with a high incidence rate and substantial impact on morbidity and mortality [1, 2]. The incidence of breast cancer varies across different regions and populations, with higher rates observed in developed countries [1]. The prevalence of breast cancer in Australia, affecting 1 in 8 women up to the age of 85, is a cause for concern due to its rising incidence rate over the past decade [3]. This trend highlights the crucial need for accurately predicting survival risks to identify high-risk patients who may benefit from more intensive treatment or monitoring, thereby potentially improving outcomes [2]. In breast cancer, the estrogen receptor (ER) status plays a critical role in determining treatment strategies and predicting patient prognosis. ER+ breast cancer, which includes Luminal A and Luminal B subtypes, is distinguished by the presence of ERs on cancer cells, making it responsive to hormonal therapies such as tamoxifen [4]. While Luminal A tumours are usually low-grade with a favorable prognosis (Ki-67<14%), Luminal B tumours are usually higher grade and pose a higher recurrence risk and worse outcome (Ki-67≥14%) [4, 5]. The inherent heterogeneity of breast cancer poses challenges for prediction of prognosis and treatment decisions, particularly in post-menopausal ER+ breast cancer, with previous studies reporting conflicting results on the survival difference between Luminal A and B metastatic breast cancer patients [6, 7]. A common critical clinical dilemma is the selection of those early ER+ breast cancer patients at high risk of recurrence who may benefit from the addition of chemotherapy to endocrine therapy. Therefore, accurate survival risk prediction models specifically tailored for ER+ breast cancer are essential for personalised treatment decisions. Traditional methods for survival risk prediction often rely on clinicopathological risk factors (such as age, tumour size, grade, lymph node metastasis and clinical stage), which may fail to fully capture the complex biology of cancer [4, 7–10]. To ad- dress this issue, molecular markers and gene expression profiles have been identified as potential prognostic factors that provide valuable insights into tumour biology and potential therapeu- tic targets [11–15]. Over the past decade, the integration of genomic testing into treatment decision-making processes has been enhanced by the utilisation of several commercial gene panels, such as Prosigna/PAM50, OncotypeDx and Endopredict arXiv:2402.10717v1  [cs.CV]  16 Feb 2024 2 Patient Details Medical Tests Treatment Diagnosis Age Group: Post Menopausal Gender: Female Ethnicity: Caucasian Clinical Exam Imaging Core Biopsy Breast-Conserving Surgery (Lumpectomy) Tumor Size: T2 Tumor Grade: G2  Hormone Receptor Status: ER+ HER2 Status: HER2- Lymph Node Status: LN- Cell Proliferation: Ki67 20% Genetic Testing PAM50/ROR,  OncotypeDX etc.  Endocrine Therapy & Radiotherapy High Risk Low Risk Adjuvant  Chemotherapy Chemotherapy Not Required Multimodal Risk Prediction Invasive Nature: IDC Ensures Adequate  Treatment Avoids Excessive  Treatment & Toxicity Figure 1: Illustration of the clinical management pathway in treating breast cancer patients. This example concerns a postmenopausal patient who has been diagnosed with breast cancer, specifically invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). The process begins with an initial diagnosis through clinical examination, imaging and core biopsy. Following this, surgery is performed to completely excise the tumour, and postoperative tumour histopathological classification is performed to assess key factors including tumour size (e.g. T2), grade (e.g. G2), hormone receptor status (e.g. ER+), HER2 status (e.g. HER2-), lymph node status (e.g. LN-), and proliferation index (e.g. Ki67 20%). Subsequent treatments may include hormone therapy and radiotherapy. Additional molecular tests, like genetic testing, are utilised to determine specific cancer molecular subtypes and further assess risk of recurrence. The proposed final step in this pathway is the application of our BioFusionNet model. This model combines tumour characteristics, pathology and genetic testing to determine high and low risk patients, thereby guiding personalised treatment decisions and efficiently preventing both under-treatment and over-treatment. For example, low-risk patients might undergo lumpectomy with hormone therapy and radiotherapy, whereas high-risk patients are advised to have chemotherapy in addition to these treatments. Whilst this pathway mirrors current clinical practice, our study streamlines the integration of all available critical data to derive an automated single risk prediction score. among others. In addition, histopathological imaging, which offers in-depth insights into the cellular and tissue characteristics of tumours, plays a vital role in both the diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer [16]. However, to address the varied nature of the disease effectively, it is essential to consider all available data modalities. Therefore, integrating imaging, genetic and clini- copathological information into a single risk prediction model could potentially enhance risk prognostication in the clinic [9]. In this study, we propose a novel multimodal survival risk predic- tion model to enhance the prognosis of ER+ breast cancer. The model uniquely integrates histopathology images, genetic pro- files and clinical data, enabling the prediction of risk scores that categorise patients into distinct risk groups aligned with their sur- vival outcomes. The model is thoroughly evaluated using metrics such as the concordance index (C-index) and time-dependent area under the curve (AUC) score, and its performance is com- pared to existing methods to establish its efficacy. Additionally, we analyse the interpretability of the model, providing insights into how different genes and clinical factors influence the risk prediction, thereby enhancing our understanding of the underly- ing predictive mechanisms. 2 Background Cancer risk prediction is of paramount importance due to its potential for guiding personalised screening, prevention and treatment strategies, ultimately leading to improved patient out- comes and reduced mortality (Fig. 1). This approach is espe- cially vital in the context of ER+ breast cancer, where accurate risk prediction is essential for identifying individuals at higher recurrence risk. These patients may benefit from more aggres- sive treatments like chemotherapy [17–20]. On the other hand, risk models are equally critical in recognising lower-risk pa- tients, potentially sparing them from unnecessary treatments and their side effects [21]. Online algorithms such as Predict1 and Adjuvant2 are used clinically to estimate the risk of recurrence and the benefit of adding chemotherapy to endocrine therapy, which is a major treatment dilemma. Developments in deep learning, such as the Cox proportional hazards deep neural network, have revolutionised cancer re- search by improving survival data modeling and treatment rec- ommendation systems [22]. Multimodal data fusion, which combines information from diverse sources such as imaging, ge- nomics and clinical data, has gained attention in cancer research due to its ability to provide a comprehensive understanding of the disease and improve predictive outcomes [23–25]. Cross- attention transformer mechanisms that integrate histopatholog- ical images and genomic data capture complementary infor- mation from different modalities, leading to improved survival prediction [26]. In this evolving landscape, models such as MultiDeepCox- SC [27], MCAT [28], MultiSurv[29], HFBSurv [30], Pathomic Fusion [31], and TransSurv [32] exemplify significant progress in multimodal analysis. Pathomic Fusion, for instance, em- ploys a gating-based attention mechanism that modulates the expressiveness of features from each modality. This approach is particularly effective in mitigating the impact of noisy uni- modal features, ensuring that the model integrates and empha- sises the most pertinent information from each data source [31]. Similarly, HFBSurv decomposes the fusion problem into differ- ent levels and integrates and passes information progressively 1https://breast.predict.nhs.uk/tool 2https://oncoassist.com/adjuvant-tools/ 3 from lower to higher levels. This hierarchical framework, with modality-specific and cross-modality attentional factorised bi- linear modules, captures and quantifies complex relations in multimodal data while reducing computational complexity [30]. Moreover, the significance of deep autoencoders in construct- ing nonlinear mappings between 2D images and 3D poses has also been emphasised, further highlighting the potential of these methods in cancer research [33]. Despite these advances, the integration of multimodal data, marked by its inherent heterogeneity and dimensional variabil- ity, remains a significant challenge, underscoring the need for advanced methodologies to effectively integrate and leverage diverse data sources for robust survival risk assessment [34–36]. A previous study has addressed ER+ breast cancer risk stratifica- tion using pathology image analysis, focussing on Nottingham grading components such as mitotic rates, nuclear pleomorphism and tubule formation [37]. However, multimodal approaches that thoroughly integrate diverse data types to accurately predict survival risks for ER+ breast cancer are currently lacking. This research gap emphasises the need for novel multimodal fusion techniques for risk prediction in ER+ breast cancer. 3 Materials and Methods 3.1 Data Collection Our study used hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained (H&E) formalin- fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) digital slides from The Can- cer Genome Atlas Breast Invasive Carcinoma (TCGA-BRCA). Whole-slide images (WSIs) from the TCGA-BRCA data collec- tion were downloaded from the GDC Portal (accessed 25 August 2023). In this work, we chose a subset of 249 cases from the TCGA-BRCA dataset, specifically focussing on two molecular subtypes: Luminal A comprising 149 samples, and Luminal B with 100 samples. Additionally, we obtained transcriptome-wide RNA-sequencing data representing mRNA expression levels for a total of 20,438 genes in the reference genome from the TCGA dataset. These data were processed using RNA-sequencing by expectation maximisation (RSEM) and were downloaded from the cBioPortal platform[38]. This dataset included a range of clinical information for each patient, such as tumour grade, tu- mour size, lymph node status, age at diagnosis and molecular subtypes. Overall, patients who had WSIs, RNA-sequencing and clinical data available were included in the study. 3.2 Data Preparation 3.2.1 Slide Annotation An expert breast pathologist manually annotated the selected slides using QuPath [39]. The annotation was performed for localization of the tumour outline, excluding any necrosis but including stroma and tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). The pathologist was blinded to any molecular or clinical features during annotation. 3.2.2 Image Data Preparation The images were first downsampled to 0.25 µm/pixel, corre- sponding to approximately 40× magnification. The annotated tumour regions were processed semi-automatically with QuPath to create 224×224-pixel patches, resulting in approximately 500 nonoverlapping patches per sample. To address staining inconsistencies, vector-based color normalization was applied [40]. 3.2.3 RNA-Sequencing Data Preparation From the extensive set of 20,438 genes, we selected genes featured in various commercial assays, namely Oncotype DX, Mammaprint, Prosigna (PAM50), EndoPredict, BCI (Breast Cancer Index), and Mammostrat [41–46], as these are the most relevant genetic markers to our study’s objectives. This resulted in a subset of 138 genes. 3.2.4 Clinical Data Preparation From the clinical data, we selected variables based on their es- tablished relevance in breast cancer prognosis and treatment outcomes [47–50]. Specifically, we included tumour grade (cat- egorised as grade 1&2 versus grade 3), tumour size (>20 mm versus ≤20 mm), patient age (>55 versus ≤55) and lymph node status (positive versus negative). 3.3 Proposed Model The proposed deep learning model, which we call BioFusion- Net, is an innovative feature extraction and multimodal fusion framework designed to leverage and integrate diverse data types, including histology images, genomic features and clinical data for enhanced cancer outcome prediction (Figs. 2 and 3). The essence of BioFusionNet lies in its capability to fuse these data modalities into a cohesive tensor representation, effectively cap- turing both bimodal and trimodal interactions. This approach is aimed at surpassing the performance of traditional unimodal and existing multimodal representations in survival risk prediction. 3.3.1 Feature Extraction Using DINO and MoCoV3 Histopathological images, rich in phenotypic information, are pivotal for understanding cancer pathology. BioFusionNet utilises two advanced self-supervised learning models, DINO (self-DIstillation with NO labels) and MoCoV3 (Momentum Contrast version 3), both based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, to extract morphological features from histology images crucial for identifying cancer-related patterns. DINO: The DINO framework employs a dual-network architec- ture, consisting of a student and a teacher network, both being ViTs. The student network learns by attempting to replicate the output of the teacher network, which in turn is an exponential moving average of the student’s parameters. The core process involves generating multiple augmented views (I1, I2, . . . , Ik) of a given input image (I), which are then processed by these net- works. The resultant feature vectors from the student (Fs) and teacher (Ft) networks are utilised to compute the distillation loss as follows: LD = k X i=1 CrossEntropy   Fs(Ii), Softmax  Ft(Ii) τ !! , (1) where τ represents the temperature scaling parameter. Notably, DINO is pretrained on a broad range of datasets, including BACH, CRC, MHIST, PatchCamelyon and CoNSeP, compris- ing 33 million patches (DINO33M), and 2 million patches from TCGA-BRCA (DINO2M) [51, 52]. The output func- tions for DINO33M and DINO2M, denoted as fDINO33M(x) and fDINO2M(x) respectively, convert an input image x of size 224 × 224 × 3 into a 1 × 384 feature vector. We utilised these two models for feature extraction: DINO33M trained on diverse datasets providing a broad perspective and enabling the model to recognise a wide array of general histopathological features, and 4  [Each Patient ×  Image Embedding (256)] . . . . . . . . .

Features are concatenated and fed to a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE). Subsequently, the latent space of the VAE is utilised to feed a self-attention network, which aggregates patch-level features into a comprehensive patient-level representation. DINO2M specifically trained on breast cancer data for more spe- cialised and precise feature extraction relevant to breast cancer pathology. MoCoV3: The MoCoV3 framework, which incorporates ViTs, represents a significant advancement in self-supervised learning through its adoption of the momentum contrast (MoCo) ap- proach [53]. At the heart of this framework lies the contrastive learning mechanism, designed to differentiate between positive and negative pairs, thereby enhancing the model’s feature learn- ing capabilities. MoCoV3’s architecture is defined by two main components: a query encoder that processes the current batch of images, and a key encoder updated via a momentum-based moving average of the query encoder’s parameters: θk ← mθk + (1 − m)θq, (2) where θk and θq are the parameters of the key and query encoders respectively and m is the momentum coefficient. This enables the key encoder to maintain a queue of encoded keys represent- ing previously seen images, thus enhancing the model’s ability to maximise agreement between differently augmented views of the same image (positive pairs) and minimise similarity with other images (negative pairs). The framework uses the InfoNCE loss [54]: LInfoNCE = − log exp(q · k+/τ) PK i=0 exp(q · ki/τ) , (3) where q and k+ are the query and positive key feature vectors, ki are the negative key vectors, K is the number of negative keys and τ is the temperature parameter. MoCoV3 has been pretrained on an extensive collection of 15 million histology patches from over 30 thousand WSIs derived from the TCGA and Pathology AI Platform (PAIP) datasets, encompassing a wide variety of cancer types and histological features. This endows the model with a robust and versatile capability to extract meaningful features from histopathological data [55]. Similar to DINO, the output function of MoCoV3, fMoCoV3(x), transforms an input image x of dimensions 224 × 224 × 3 into a 1 × 384 feature vector. 3.3.2 Unimodal Feature Integration Extracted features from DINO33M, DINO2M and MoCoV3 are concatenated to form a comprehensive 1 × 1152 feature vector fcat(x) = fDINO33M(x) ⊕ fDINO2m(x) ⊕ fMoCoV3(x) (Fig. 2). Following this, we employ a VAE to encode the integrated image features into a 256-dimensional feature in latent space. The latent feature vector is then passed through a self-attention model and aggregated using sum pooling to generate patient- level features. 3.3.3 Feature Fusion Using Variational Autoencoding Our VAE consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder function fenc maps the concatenated feature vector fcat(x) to the latent space by generating the mean µ and standard deviation σ of the latent representation: (µ, σ) = fenc(fcat(x)). (4) With 500 patches per patient, the latent space is structured as a matrix of size 500 × 256. This is achieved by sampling z using 5  [ Each Patient ×  Image Embedding (256)]  [ Each Patient ×  No. of Genes (138)] Fully-connected 128 + 4 Risk Score 256 32 [ Each Patient × Clinical Features (4)] Fully-connected Fully-connected 512 ... ≈ ≈ ... ≈ ≈ ... ≈ ≈ ... ≈ ≈ Transformer  Encoder Co Dual Cross Attention Co Attention  Dual Cross Attention Multi-Head  Self-Attention Feed-Forward  Network (FFN) Transformer Encoder Key  Query Value Softmax Cross Attention + Layer Normalization Dropout Matrix Multiplication Concatenation + + + + x1  x2  xout  fin  fout I G AIG AGI CIG CGI DIG DGI Tcat Figure 3: BioFusionNet Stage 2: The proposed model fuses image embeddings generated from Stage 1 with genetic data through a co-dual-cross-attention mechanism. This fusion is subsequently combined with clinical data using a feed-forward network (FFN), leading to the generation of the final risk score output. the reparameterization trick: z = µ + σ · ϵ, ϵ ∼ N(0, I), z ∈ R500×256. (5) The decoder fdec then attempts to reconstruct the input from the latent variable z: ˆx = fdec(z). (6) The VAE is optimised using a loss function that combines mean squared error (MSE) for reconstruction accuracy and Kullback- Leibler (KL) divergence for distribution regularisation: LVAE = MSE(ˆx, x) + β · KL(N(µ, σ2)∥N(0, I)), (7) where β balances the reconstruction and regularisation terms. The MSE term ensures that the reconstructed image closely resembles the original input, while the KL divergence term encourages the latent distribution to approximate a standard normal distribution. This enables BioFusionNet to effectively blend the features from the different self-supervised models, enhancing the overall feature representation. 3.3.4 Patch-to-Patient Aggregation To aggregate the patch-level features from the latent space of the VAE into a comprehensive patient-level representation capturing the interdependencies among image patches, our model uses self-attention (Fig. 2). The self-attention module computes a weighted sum of the key (K), query (Q), and value (V) vectors: yi = 500 X j=1 Softmax \u0010 s(Qi, K j) \u0011 Vj, (8) where s(Qi, Kj) is the attention function that determines the rel- evance between each query and key pair. This offers two signifi- cant benefits. First, by leveraging the VAE’s latent vectors, the model focusses on the most pertinent image features, resulting in a more precise feature representation. Second, by consid- ering all latent representations, the self-attention mechanism contextualises each patch within the broader histopathology of the patient. 3.3.5 Multimodal Fusion Using Co Dual Cross Attention To integrate patient-level image embeddings with genetic fea- ture data, our model uses a co-dual-cross-attention mechanism (Fig. 3). This is achieved using a complex architecture compris- ing co-attention and dual-cross-attention modules. The co-attention module applies linear transformations to the image embeddings I and genetic features G, yielding their re- spective query (Q), key (K), and value (V) vectors, and computes the co-attention scores between them as: AIG = Softmax \u0010 QIKT G \u0011 VG, (9) AGI = Softmax \u0010 QGKT I \u0011 VI, (10) 6 where AIG represents the attention from images to genetic fea- tures, and AGI the attention from genetic features to images. The Softmax function normalises these scores, facilitating an effec- tive weighting of feature importance in the fusion process. This bidirectional attention prepares the ground for more complex in- teractions in the subsequent stage of the co-dual-cross-attention mechanism. Subsequently, the dual-cross-attention module further refines the integration of the image and genetic features in two distinct stages. The first stage concerns the interaction between the co- attended image features (AIG) and co-attended genetic features (AGI). The cross attention is computed as: CIG = Softmax \u0010 AIG(AGI)T\u0011 AIG, (11) CGI = Softmax \u0010 AGI(AIG)T\u0011 AGI, (12) where CIG represents the cross-attention output when image fea- tures attend to genetic features, and CGI the reverse. This stage is crucial for enhancing each modality by integrating contextu- ally relevant information from the other. In the second stage, the outputs from the first stage are further refined by reapplying them to their respective original features. This enhances the depth of the multimodal integration: DIG = Softmax \u0010 CIGIT\u0011 I, (13) DGI = Softmax \u0010 CGIGT\u0011 G, (14) where DIG and DGI denote the refined cross-attention outputs, further enhancing the original image and genetic data with addi- tional contextual insights. By sequentially processing the attended features, the model achieves a richer and more contextually informed representation of the fused image and genetic data, suited for complex tasks like risk prediction. The concatenated output Tcat = DIG ⊕ DGI is fed to a Transformer Encoder, which employs multiple layers of self-attention and a feed-forward network (FFN) to achieve a deeper assimilation and transformation of the fused features. The output of the Transformer Encoder is then processed by four fully-connected layers, the third of which also integrates the clinical information (Fig. 3). The integration of clinical variables at this stage is crucial due to their dimensionality and characteristics. Clinical data, comprising only four features, may be overshadowed by the higher-dimensional features from histopathological images and genetic profiles if introduced ear- lier in the model. By embedding these variables in a later layer, their impact is more directly and effectively mapped onto the model’s output, preserving their significant influence on survival risk prediction. This multimodal integration results in a holistic representation of both the phenotypic and genotypic information of ER+ breast cancer. Finally, the network employs a linear output layer that predicts the survival risk score. 3.4 Proposed Loss Function For training BioFusionNet, we propose a novel loss function termed the weighted Cox loss (computed by Algorithm 1), which is tailored to address the challenges of imbalanced survival data (a common issue in survival analysis): LWCox = − 1 PN i=1 wiei N X i=1 wiei(ri − log(Hwi)), (15) Algorithm 1 Weighted Cox Loss Require: r: risks (log hazard ratios), e: events, w: weights Ensure: LWCox: negative log likelihood loss 1: Compute Ew = PN i=1 wiei as total weighted events 2: Sort samples by descending r and align e, w 3: for i ∈ 1, . . . , N do ▷ N is the number of samples 4: Compute hazard ratio hi = exp(ri) 5: end for 6: Init weighted cumulative hazard Hw0 = 0 7: for i ∈ 1, . . . , N do 8: Update cumulative sum Hwi = Hwi−1 + wihi 9: end for 10: for i ∈ 1, . . . , N do 11: Compute uncensored log likelihood ui = wi(ri − log(Hwi)) 12: end for 13: Compute c = u ⊙ e ▷ ⊙ is the element-wise product 14: Compute loss LWCox = − 1 Ew PN i=1 ci 15: return LWCox where ei denotes the event occurrence, wi the assigned weight, ri the log hazard ratio, Hwi the weighted cumulative hazard and N the number of samples. Unlike the traditional Cox proportional hazards loss (LCox) [22], the proposed loss uses weighting to mitigate the effects of uneven distribution of events within the dataset. In this work we used wi = 3, considering that censored data (denoted as ‘0’) is almost three times as prevalent as event data (denoted as ‘1’), and thus the sensitivity of the loss function to the latter should be enhanced accordingly, mitigating the bias towards censored data. 3.5 Model Training The training of BioFusionNet is divided into two distinct stages as follows (Figs. 2 and 3): Stage 1: Feature Extraction: The self-supervised pretrained models DINO33M, MoCoV3 and DINO2M extract features from histopathology image patches, which are concatenated and then fed into a VAE to produce embeddings, which in turn are processed by a self-attention module to produce a patient- level feature vector (Fig. 2). The VAE was optimised using AdamW with a learning rate of 0.0001 and a batch size of 12. The employed loss function is a combination of MSE and KL divergence, targetting the construction of an advanced latent space to generate detailed patient-level features. Stage 2: Risk Prediction: The proposed co-dual-cross-attention mechanism, followed by multiple FFNs and a final output node that uses a linear activation function, predicts the patient-level risk from the image-based, genetic and clinical information (Fig. 3). Here, training was performed using the proposed weighted Cox loss (LWCox), which was optimised using the Adam algorithm with a learning rate of 0.001 and a batch size of 12. To mitigate overfitting, an early stopping mechanism based on the validation loss was implemented. This involved halting the training process after a patience period of 10 epochs if no improvement was observed. Both training stages used a dataset comprising 199 training sam- ples and 50 validation samples within a five-fold cross-validation framework. The trained model predicts a continuous risk score for every patient within each validation fold.

The C-index assesses the concordance between predicted survival times and observed outcomes, especially in the presence of censored data: C-index = nP i=1 nP j=1 I(yi < y j, δi = 1)I( ˆf(xi) < ˆf(x j)) nP i=1 nP j=1 I(yi < yj, δi = 1) . (16) where n is the number of patients, yi and y j denote the observed survival times, δi indicates whether the event was observed (not censored), ˆf(xi) represents the predicted risk for the ith patient, and I is the indicator function that returns 1 when its condition is true and 0 otherwise. The time-dependent AUC offers a dynamic view of the model accuracy over time t and incorporates weights ωi, and is calculated using the following formula: AUC(t) = nP i=1 nP j=1 ωiI(yi ≤ t)I(y j > t)I( ˆf(xj) ≤ ˆf(xi)) nP i=1 ωiI(yi ≤ t) nP i=1 I(yi > t) . (17) Both the C-index and AUC values range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better performance. 4 Experimental Results 4.1 Comparison Across Modalities The effectiveness of BioFusionNet in cancer risk prediction was evaluated by comparing its C-index performance across different modality configurations. The results (Table 1) show that the mean performance in the cross-validation experiments consistently increased from using only imaging data, to using imaging and genetic data, to combining imaging, genetic and clinical data. Two traditional methods, namely Cox Proportional Hazards (CoxPH) and Random Survival Forests (RSF), were also evaluated, showing no consistent advantage in using genetic and clinical data as opposed to only clinical data, and performing worse than BioFusionNet. 4.2 Comparison With State-of-the-Art Fusion Methods The performance of BioFusionNet was compared with several state-of-the-art multimodal fusion methods for cancer risk pre- diction in terms of both C-index and AUC (Table 2). For this ex- periment we included methods using concatenation (MultiSurv), hierarchical attention (HFBSurv), gating attention (Pathomic- Fusion), co-attention (MCAT) and cross attention (TransSurv). The AUC was calculated using average values over 5-year and 10-year periods. The proposed model consistently outperformed all these previous methods, showing substantial improvements in both metrics. 4.3 Evaluation of Loss Functions The performance of two different loss functions was compared using the C-index across five cross-validation folds for Bio- FusionNet and MoCoV3 (Table 3).

Both univariate and multivariate analyses were performed (Table 4). The analysis encompassed various parameters, including tumour grade, tumour size, age, lymph node (LN) status, subtype and the risk predictions made by BioFusionNet. In the multivariate analysis, positive LN status was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.87 (95% CI: 1.32–2.64), demonstrating a significant effect on survival (p < 0.005). Additionally, patients over the age of 55 had a HR of 1.77 (95% CI: 1.07–2.91), also showing a significant impact on survival (p = 0.03). However, no signif- icant associations were found between tumour grade, size, or subtype and survival outcomes in this analysis. Notably, the BioFusionNet-predicted risk group (high vs. low) demonstrated a significant correlation with OS, with a HR of 2.91 (95% CI: 1.80–4.68) (p < 0.005). Univariate analysis indicated that tumour grade, size, age, and subtype were not statistically significant, whereas LN status (HR of 1.84, 95% CI: 1.33–2.55, p < 0.005) and BioFusionNet risk group (HR of 2.99, 95% CI: 1.88–4.78, p < 0.005) were significant predictors of survival. We note that the LN status had 51 missing values, which were imputed using a fixed value of 2. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis further sup- ported the results, showing a significant difference in survival probabilities between the high- and low-risk groups as predicted by BioFusionNet (log-rank test p = 6.45e-7) (Fig. 4c). 4.5 Ablation Study We also evaluated the performance of various versions of Bio- FusionNet for ER+ breast cancer risk stratification. The re- sults (Table 5) show that the base model, BioFusionNet-B0 (MoCoV3, ViT Small) with LWCox, achieved the lowest C- index, and incorporating single cross-attention (SCA), dual cross-attention (DCA), or co-attention (CoA) yielded slight im- provements, as did BioFusionNet-B1 (DINO33M, ViT Small) and BioFusionNet-B2 (DINO2M, ViT Small), both with DCA and LWCox. Combining BioFusionNet-B0, B1, and B2 with just LWCox also resulted in slightly better performance than the base model, as did the inclusion of SCA and VAE. More substantial improvements of the combined model were obtained with the inclusion of DCA or CoA instead of SCA. The best performance was achieved by the combined model using VAE, CoA and DCA with LWCox, which clearly outperformed the same model using the traditional Cox loss LCox. 4.6 Interpretability of BioFusionNet BioFusionNet utilises a self-attention mechanism to analyse histopathological image patches, identifying regions of high and low attention within both high-risk and low-risk patient pro- files. Visual inspection of the results (Fig. 5) reveals that regions with high attention contain distinct cellular patterns crucial for synthesising features from patch-level to patient-level, whereas 9 Table 4: Univariate and multivariate analysis for overall survival (OS) in the TCGA dataset of ER+ patients.

This shows the model capacity to pinpoint clinically relevant features within tissue morphology. Additionally, SHAP analysis (Fig. 6) reveals the influence of individual genes on the model predic- tions, ranked from high to low, providing interpretability of the risk assessment process. From this analysis, gene SLC39A6 (an estrogen regulated Zinc transporter protein with a role in epithe- lial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)) was identified as the most important predictor, with high expression levels producing high SHAP values, indicating positive impact on the model’s cancer risk prediction. Other influential genes include ERBB2 (the gene for HER2), ESR1 (the gene for ER), with low expression levels producing high SHAP values therefore positive impact on the model. Moreover, the distribution of SHAP values for clinical features (Fig. 7) indicates that higher values of clinical parameters—such as positive LN status, higher tumour grade, increased tumour size, and postmenopausal age group—tend to have a positive impact on the model’s output. In this context, a ‘positive impact’ implies that the model associates these values with a higher likelihood of predicting patients at high risk. 5 Discussion and Conclusion As demonstrated by the experimental results, the proposed Bio- FusionNet is highly effective for cancer risk prediction, show- ing superior performance compared to alternative approaches. Clearly, the multimodal fusion of imaging, genetic and clinical data allows the model to achieve substantially higher C-index scores compared to unimodal and dual-modal configurations, as well as compared to the traditional Cox Proportional Hazards and Random Survival Forests methods. Furthermore, BioFu- sionNet outperforms existing multimodal fusion methods such as MultiSurv, HFBSurv, PathomicFusion, MCAT and TransSurv, and achieves the highest mean C-index (0.77 ± 0.05) and AUC (0.84 ± 0.05). Partly, the superior performance of BioFusionNet is due to the introduction of the proposed weighted Cox loss function instead of using the traditional Cox loss. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed the significant impact of age and BioFusionNet predictions on survival outcomes, while other clinical parameters such as tumour grade, size, lymph node sta- tus and subtype did not exhibit a significant correlation with survival outcomes. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a distinct separation in survival probabilities between the high-risk and low-risk groups identified by BioFusionNet. In addition, the results of the ablation experiment confirmed the importance of attention mechanisms in improving prediction accuracy, with the combined model configuration utilising VAE, CoA and DCA and the weighted Cox loss showing the highest performance. BioFusionNet also presents a significant advancement in the interpretation of histopathological images, leveraging a self- attention mechanism to distinguish critical regions in patient profiles. A key contribution is the model’s ability to align high- attention areas with distinct cellular patterns, crucial for tran- sitioning from patch-level to patient-level analysis, thereby en- hancing the diagnostic process. SHAP analysis amplifies this by clarifying the influence of specific genes and clinical fea- tures on the model’s predictions. We observed that elevated SLC39A6 gene expression correlates with a high-risk prediction in ER+ breast cancers, where previous studies have shown con- flicting findings, associating high SLC39A6 levels with good prognosis [58, 59], while others associated it with increased pro- liferation and lymph node involvement [60–62]. Similarly, our model identified high ESR1 expression as indicative of low risk, aligning with literature that associates ESR1 positivity with en- hanced responsiveness to endocrine therapy and, consequently, a better prognosis in ER+ breast cancer patients [63]. In con- trast, our analysis revealed an unexpected association between ERBB2 overexpression and a favorable prognosis in ER+ breast tumours, contrasting with the established view that ERBB2 over- expression indicates a poor prognosis [64, 65]. As our study was specifically tailored to analyze ER+ samples, excluding the HER2-enriched subtype (known for its high ERBB2 expression and aggressiveness) likely influenced the findings. Moreover, the SHAP analysis for clinical factors (LN positivity, higher tumour grade and size, and postmenopausal age) significantly influences our model’s ability to identify patients at increased risk, highlighting the critical role of these factors in breast cancer prognosis. Our analysis provides a transparent understanding of 10 Low Risk High Risk Luminal A Luminal B Risk Type High Attention Low Attention High Attention Low Attention TCGA-A7-A13H TCGA-AR-A2LK TCGA-B6-A0IN TCGA-A2-A259 Figure 5: Visualisation of model-derived attention regions and associated risk types in Luminal A and Luminal B breast cancer patients.

Figure 7: SHAP value distribution of clinical features. In this distribu- tion, higher clinical values showing positive impact on the model, as indicated by its SHAP values. how each gene and clinical feature contributes to the model’s predictions, providing actionable insights for clinical decision- making. While the risk assessment process mirrors current clinical practice, BioFusionNet streamlines the integration of all available data (patient features, tumour features and molecular features) to derive an automated single risk prediction score as a potential clinical oncology tool of the future. While insightful, this study has certain limitations. We primarily opted for OS as the key outcome measure, instead of disease-free survival (DFS). This choice was made because DFS presented challenges such as a lower rate of events and a higher degree of data censorship, which could have limited the depth of the analysis. While OS is a feasible choice, it potentially overlooks critical insights into early-stage disease progression, typically highlighted by DFS. Moreover, the study’s reliance on specific datasets such as TCGA for ER+ patients may affect the broad applicability of our findings. Another shortcoming of this study is the inherent limitations of the clinical data, which, during univariate analysis, identified tumour size, grade, and age as in- significant while only LN Status emerged as significant. Despite its limitations, the effectiveness of deep learning algorithms in analysing this clinical data arises from their ability to uncover complex patterns and interactions within dataset. Future re- search should therefore aim to validate these findings across a wider range of datasets to bolster the model’s generalisability. Incorporating organ-level data, such as mammograms, could fur- ther enhance the predictive accuracy of our model. Additionally, extending the application of BioFusionNet to other cancer types and clinical scenarios could yield more comprehensive insights, making the research more universally relevant and applicable.
