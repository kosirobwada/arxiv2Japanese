Abstract  We devised a general heterogeneous microstructural design methodology applied to a  specific material system, elasto-electro-active piezoelectric ceramic embedded plastics, which  has great potential in sensing, 5G communication, and energy harvesting. Due to the  multiphysics interactions of the studied material system, we have developed an accurate and  efficient FFT-based numerical method to find the multifunctional properties of diverse cellular  microstructures generated by our HetMiGen code. To mine this big dataset, we used our  customized physics-aware generative neural network in the format of a VAE with convolutional  neural layers augmented by a vision transformer to learn long-distance features which may affect  the properties of the 3D voxelized microstructures. In training, the decoder learns how to map  the property distribution to the appropriate high-dimensional distribution of 3D microstructures.  2    Therefore, it can be considered an online material designer within the explored design space  during its inference phase.

Introduction  Multifunctional microstructural materials are emerging composite or heterogeneous  materials designed to possess both functional and mechanical properties dictated by their  microstructures which are described by a repeating unit cell or a periodic Representative Volume  Element (RVE) [1]. They can be used in a range of applications such as lightweight thermo- structural panels, blast resistant structures, high-authority morphing components [2], structural  sensors [3], wearable electronics [4], and energy harvesters [5‚Äì7]. Integrating various properties  and functions within a single piece of material simplifies manufacturing and reduces cost.  Additive manufacturing (AM) allows precise control over materials‚Äô geometry, composition, and  morphology [8‚Äì11]. While this has led to the development of materials with single properties,  there has been little exploration of using microstructure to design manufacturable multifunctional  materials. Designing microstructural materials with simultaneous multiple optimum properties,  such as piezoelectric composites [12‚Äì14] with excellent piezoelectricity and flexibility, is a much  more challenging task than designing materials based on a single property. Existing single- function design strategies suffer from several limitations, including (1) a lack of accurate and fast  physical models for predicting material behavior, (2) high costs or morphological limitations of  in-silico microstructure generation techniques, (3) multiple expensive offline optimization cycles  for different target performances, (4) lack of modularity and generality to tackle diverse design  problems, (5) reliance on purely data-driven approaches limited to the locality of convolutional  operators in deep learners, (6) and imperfect translation of abstract designs into actual products  3    due to manufacturing uncertainties and limitations. In this research effort, we aimed to develop a  novel machine learning (ML)-driven design framework that can transform the current paradigm  of material development into a more efficient and effective approach for designing  manufacturable microstructural materials with desirable multifunctional properties. To achieve  this goal, we pursued four objectives summarized in Figure 4.1: (1) developing a universal and  fast in-silico voxelized microstructure generator, (2) developing accurate and rapid numerical  homogenization methods for microstructural materials to obtain multifunctional and mechanical  properties, (3) establishing bi-directional structure-property relationships by training our novel  ML model (TransVNet) to handle sequential properties and physical constraints, and (4)  validating the framework by manufacturing and characterizing designed microstructural  materials using AM.

Interactive design loop of our proposed methodology for multifunctional  microstructural materials.  Since microstructural material morphology influences its properties [15,16], finding the  target morphology has been the focus of many studies in the field of material design. To  effectively explore the design space, it is crucial to employ appropriate methods. Microstructure  design methods developed based on the rich microstructure characterization and reconstruction  literature [17] are limited to some target exemplars from experiments [18‚Äì20] or involve  expensive simulations [21,22] and cannot be used for different material systems. For example,  descriptor-based methods may be used only for particulate composites, not heterogeneous ones  [23,24]. Furthermore, material design methods that focus on optimizing a high-resolution  microstructure or a massive number of design variables usually require many candidate  microstructures with significantly varied features to converge to the best possible solution. This,  in turn, calls for a fast and efficient microstructure generation method. These two gaps in the  current state-of-the-art motivated us to propose a new method for heterogeneous microstructure  generation (HetMiGen) to artificially generate 3D microstructures with no need for reference 2D  images of physical material. The core ideas for our proposed algorithm stem from previous  studies on developing statistical microstructure reconstruction techniques for materials [25‚Äì29].  HetMiGen provides distinct capabilities not present in other synthetic microstructure generators,  such as Dream3D [30]. While Dream3D is limited to producing polycrystalline microstructures,  HetMiGen enables the controlled inclusion of various shapes and distributions, including  anisotropy and cellular morphology. The details of our new algorithm and its computational  implementation are discussed in section 4.3.  To complete the data generation for our material design methodology, an efficient  computational homogenizer is needed to find effective material properties. Considering 3D  5    voxelized microstructure models with N grid points per dimension, the computational effort for  FFT simulations scales with ùëÅùëÅ log ùëÅùëÅ, which is much more efficient than the ùëÅùëÅ3 scaling observed  in FEM simulations. Therefore, we have developed FFT simulation codes to numerically solve  the governing PDE equations of the homogenization problem. There has been a strong interest in  developing FFT computational methods for multifunctional and multi-phase composite  materials. However, for piezoelectricity, the methods available in the literature [31,32] are not  suitable to converge to the solution in the heterogeneous microstructures whose phase boundaries  are complex and irregular, and the property contrast ratio of composite constituents is high. Also,  the enthalpy formulation found in the previous FFT work [31,32] leads to a saddle-point  variational minimization problem which is more challenging to solve than the convex variational  minimization via the energy formulation of the constitutive laws. Our homogenization method is  explained in section 4.4.   Computational material design has emerged as a promising approach to accelerate the  discovery of new materials with tailored properties and functions. Traditionally, material  knowledge has been explored using physics-based Process-Structure-Properties (PSP) models  and/or experiments in the forward direction (from process to structure to properties). However,  material design inherently drives discovery in the inverse direction, which requires the  establishment of reduced-order PSP linkages [33,34] using regression or statistical learning  techniques on data produced by PSP models and physical experiments. Alternatively, novel  mining techniques may be used on the big data generated [22,35‚Äì37] through accurate and  efficient computational models with limited experimental calibrations and validations. The  second route is more suitable for material systems in which the process is directly linked to the  material‚Äôs structure via advanced additive manufacturing [38,39] in mesoscale or traditional  6    computer numerical control (CNC) machining of a topology-optimized (TO) structure in macro- scale [40‚Äì42]. However, TO [43] methods lack the generalizability of the newer computational  methods based on generative models in ML [22,36,37] since they solve the optimization problem  for each user-specified set of goals and constraints. In contrast, the ML-based ones are trained  once and then used in the inference mode almost instantly with much less computational cost. At  the same time, TOs are more computationally demanding even for one target property due to  their dependency on FEM. Although purely convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become  widespread in ML-based methods, they lack an understanding of the input image's long-range  relationships due to the intrinsic locality of convolution operators, resulting in a weak  performance for structures with a large inter-sample variation. That is where Transformers [44]  came into play by leveraging their self-attention mechanisms. However, their naive use may lead  to poor results as they focus exclusively on the global contexts of 1D sequences. Recent research  has demonstrated superior performance by combining Vision Transformers (ViTs) [45] with  CNN feature extractors [46]. Building upon these advancements, our network (TransVNet)  directly works with 3D voxelized microstructures instead of stacks of 2D slices and is most  beneficial when the quantities of interest are affected by long-range voxel/phase relationships  that are not captured by the local convolutional operators used in CNNs. It will also be useful  when those quantities are sequential and inputs are in a mixed format, which are challenging to  encode using current material design methods. The network has been developed such that  physics and context constraints can be considered invariances in training, following the rise of  physics-informed networks [47] in scientific machine learning. This will make the computational  framework more efficient and modular for more complex future applications while avoiding  7    using data-hungry deep learners commonly used in computational materials science. The  network and its relation to material design is discussed in section 4.5.  Polymer-ceramic composites have tremendous potential for multifunctional devices, such  as energy harvesting devices (e.g., wearable electronics and healthcare sensors) [48] and high- frequency antennas [49], as they come with tunable and advantageous mechanical properties  such as high compliances, toughness, and yield strains. However, the polymer-ceramic  composites with randomly dispersed ceramic particles have poor piezoelectric properties [50]  (Figure 4.2(a)). Furthermore, the polymer-ceramic composite of 1‚Äì3 has superb energy  harvesting properties only in the fiber direction (Figure 4.2(b)). To overcome these challenges,  the mesoscale geometry of composites should be optimized by tailoring the ceramic phase  morphologies. In recent years, there has been an increased interest in developing 3‚Äì3 (Figure  4.2(c)) complex geometry of composites, for example, 3D interconnected composites with  continuous ceramic skeletons that possess superb energy harvesting [51,52]. Also, this material  system is suitable for high-frequency antenna applications (such as 5G), and the morphology  significantly affects the electric permittivity and loss in different frequency ranges. A  considerable challenge of fabricating such composites is to precisely control the complicated  mesoscale geometry featured by the randomness and interconnectivity of the interfaces and  achieve the desired functional properties in the final structures. With the merits of dealing with  complex geometries, additive manufacturing has been widely studied and applied to fabricate  polymer-ceramic composites [52,53]. There have been a few efforts to numerically generate this  kind of geometries [54,55]. However, such constructed geometries can still not guarantee fiber  morphology and interconnectivity [54]. A few studies have been devoted to the topological  optimization of piezoelectric structures [56‚Äì58]; however, our proposed design methodology  8    does not have the conventional restriction of the TO methods mentioned above. With these  insights, we have systematically investigated the effect of mesoscale geometry on stiffness,  piezoelectric, and dielectric properties of flexible polymer-ferroelectric composites.   Furthermore, we designed these material systems for target performances using our new deep  generative network. This network has been trained on the dataset comprising various cellular  morphologies generated through our HetMiGen algorithm and their corresponding homogenized  multiphysics properties obtained using our high-fidelity/accurate fast FFT method. The details of  manufacturing and experimental characterization are discussed in section 4.6. To show the  capabilities of our proposed methodology framework, we have run our computational codes and  validated them based on the PDMS-BTO material system with PDMS/matrix and BTO/inclusion  properties obtained from [59,60] and [61], respectively. We experimentally measured the  piezoelectric and dielectric properties of multiple samples synthesized based on a microstructure  in our in-silico generated dataset to validate our computational results.

HetMiGen generating a novel virtual database of cellular microstructures  A fast and computationally efficient program, called HetMiGen (short for Heterogeneous  Microstructure Generator), has been developed to artificially generate 3D heterogeneous  microstructures without the need to any reference 2D cut section images of physical material  9    microstructures through expensive experimental methods such as SEM. This in-silico data  generation is especially useful for computational materials science since it does not rely on the  reconstruction techniques based on some expensive experiments, let alone the physically  material processing complications with the shortcoming of not being able to consider all the  design space for material design purposes. The C++ source codes can be compiled for and  deployed on different machines with Linux or Windows OSs, and the executable can be readily  run given a CSV file whose each line contains the microstructural parameters of the  microstructure to be generated: the microstructure id number, the number of phases in addition to  the background phase, the volume fraction of each phase, the number of initial seeds, the  increment (positive or negative) of seeds‚Äô addition in the next seed addition iterations, the  frequency by which seeds are added, the radius of the local neighborhood to be checked for  proximity for each phase (zero means no check is needed and seeds can be grown until they  touch others), whether each phase should be clustered at the end, the rate of growth decay for  each phase (zero means that growth parameters are fixed throughout the evolution iterations),  and the probabilistic growth thresholds for Cellular Automate [62] based on the considered  neighborhood type (von Neumann in the current version of the codes). By changing the input  parameters, it can generate multitudes of heterogenous microstructures of different material  systems consisting of two or more material phases with different morphologies. The parameters  have affinity to the physical process of manufacturing and thermomechanical evolution of  microstructure as well.  Although the program is efficient in its serial implementation (e.g., generating a  bincontinous 1503 resolution microstructure in around two minutes normally), for massive data  generation in ML/data-driven material science, the codes have been written using parallel  10    programming techniques of OpenMP for single HPC nodes or workstations (shared memory  architectures) and OpenMPI for multiple HPC nodes or cloud computing servers (heterogenous  memory architectures). Due to loop-carried dependencies and to minimize communication  overheads, task parallelization through SPMD style of programming was implemented to gain  speed-up by dividing microstructure generation tasks into a pool of processors. To demonstrate  the speed-up gain, 32 identical input data with the same seeding of random generators were  considered so that the computational loads are balanced among all processors and between  different configurations (from 16 cores to one core). A decent speed-up in each step was  achieved as shown in Figure 4.3 for the OpenMP version. The imperfection may be attributed to  the thread management (forking and joining) and memory contention on the CPU cache level.    Figure 4.3. Speed-up for different configurations in a log-log scale.  As shown in the algorithm flowchart of Figure 4.4, HetMiGen algorithm is based on two  basic mechanisms and an addendum to create the special type of microstructures with clustered  phases such as bincontinous or cellular ones: Seed Addition, Seed Growth, and Clustering.  During Seed Addition, if the current iteration is designated for such operations according to the  frequency of seed addition, at most as many as the current number of seed addition, which is the  256 512 1024 2048 4096 1 2 4 8 16 Computation time (s) Number of used processors (cores) 11    summation of the previous number of seeds and the increment parameter, are dispersed in the  cuboid domain of the microstructure according to the quasirandom Sobol sequence [63] for  uniform dispersion in 3D space. Proximity Check1 means that the chosen seed position which  should be an empty voxel (encoded with the background color) can turn into a phase voxel  (encoded with a pre-designated foreground color) if its neighbors in a r-radius neighborhood,  with r being one of the input parameters, are all empty. In the top right 2D image of the figure,  the white pixels are the current empty or background ones, the dark blue ones are the seeds  which have been added before the current stage of Seed Growth for that image, and the light blue  ones are the pixels grown according to cellular automata. Therefore, there is an iterative process  of seed addition in each iteration of the microstructure evolution until all current number of seeds  are added, or the process proves to be stagnant following an exhaustive search for the right  position of the last seed. Immediately after this part, the cells will be grown probabilistically in  different directions according to a cellular automata algorithm and the chosen neighborhood type  like the von Neumann one shown by the cross-hatched pixels of the 2D image. The thresholds  for the probabilistic growths are calculated as the decay factor times the initial threshold, and the  random trial for each neighborhood voxel is simulated by the pseudo-random number generator  MT19937 (Mersenne Twister) [64] resulting in a float number between 0 and 1 drawn from a  uniform distribution in every function call. So larger thresholds in each direction mean higher  chances of growth in that direction leading to different levels and directions of anisotropy in the  final evolved microstructure. In Seed Growth, Next interface voxel is a phase voxel which has at  least one empty voxel in its immediate von Neumann neighborhood, which can be considered as  a potential location to perform Cellular Automata. Proximity Check2 is similar to Proximity  Check1 except that the empty condition is appended by an alternative: if the voxels in its local  12    neighborhood all belong to the same cluster of phase voxels (called a cell hereafter). After each  iteration of Seed Growth, the volume fraction of each foreground phase is calculated. If they are  close to the target input parameters within an acceptable tolerance, the program will be  terminated by converting the binary data of the last evolution of the microstructure into 8-bit  BMP images, as shown by the post-processed/smoothed image of the 3D bone microstructure in  the figure. Another alternative for termination is that if the evolution has been stagnant, i.e., there  has been no increase in current volume fractions after 5 evolution iterations, the program is  failed, and it will attempt to regenerate by starting the random sequences (Sobol for seed  positioning and MT19937 for seed growth) with another seeding number. If the failure persists  after five trials, the program will move on to generate the next requested microstructure.  If a foreground phase should be clustered according to the input parameters, the volume  fraction check will be done based on a lower volume fraction target (85%) to let the clustering  algorithm work with current cells by connecting them and adding more foreground phase voxels.  The clustering algorithm tries to connect the isolated cells of the grown seeds where they are  close to each other by passing through all empty voxels, checking whether at least two isolated  cells of the material phase to be clustered are present in the local r-radius neighborhood of the  current empty voxel, and turning all the empty voxels in the neighborhood into the phase color if  at least two isolated cells are found, and the measured phase density in the local neighborhood is  higher than the threshold in the current iteration. This process is also iterative in that the phase  density threshold is incrementally decreased to prioritize connections where the cells are closest  to each other, and if the density threshold cannot be further lowered (i.e., zero), the radius of the  local neighborhood for density measurement is increased. The iterative algorithm is terminated if  13    the volume fraction goes out of a tolerance band around the requested volume fraction, or if  more than 90% of the phase voxels are connected to each other.  As mentioned in the introduction, the design space of heterogeneous or cellular  microstructures is huge as each voxel of 1503-resolution 3D image can be attributed to a single  material phase. Since our design methodology is based on machine learning to find the complex  bi-directional structure-property mappings, we generated a big dataset of bincontinous or cellular  microstructures, represented by their 2D slice images, to consider different morphological  possibilities and to train our network on a highly diverse and inclusive dataset. Therefore, a list  of different HetMiGen input parameters, including different volume fraction numbers and  anisotropy and dispersion/seed numbers, was generated according to Sobol sequence within  ranges specified by the physical constraints and sensitivity analysis in the code results. As  illustrated in Figure 4.5, the resulting dataset was skewed despite the maximum dispersion nature  of Sobol sampling because some sets of input parameters are very challenging, i.e., taking too  much computational time, or even impossible to be successfully simulated. Therefore, a fixed  number of microstructures was considered in each volume fraction bin to have a balanced  exposure in the network training.  14      Figure 4.4.

Characterizing the Generated Microstructures via our Multiphysics FFT  Homogenization Method  Applications of piezoelectric materials in small strain regime is the focus of this study.  The deformation and the electrostatic status of an electro-mechanical continuum body can be  described by the displacement ùë¢ùë¢, a vector field, and the electric field potential ùúôùúô, a scalar field.  The gradient fields induced by them are the linearized strain field ùúñùúñ = 1 2 (‚àáùë¢ùë¢ + ùë¢ùë¢‚àá) with its  energetic conjugate of stress tensor field ùúéùúé and the electric vector field ùê∏ùê∏ = ‚àáùúôùúô with its energetic  conjugate of electric displacement vector field ùê∑ùê∑, respectively. The quasi-static mechanical  governing PDE equations are the compatibility one, ‚àá √ó ùúñùúñ √ó ‚àá= 0, and the balance of linear  momentum in the absence of external forces, ‚àá. ùúéùúé = 0. There are four possible constitutive  formulations according to the desired input and output variables: Stress-Charge, Stress-Voltage,  16    Strain-Charge, and Strain-Voltage. Only strain loading is considered in macroscale in this paper,  and these are the corresponding linear constitutive relations:  Table 4.1. Linear electroelastic constitutive relationships.  Stress-Charge form  Stress-Voltage form  ùúéùúé = ‚ÑÇùê∏ùê∏=0: ùúñùúñ ‚àí ùëíùëíùëáùëá. ùê∏ùê∏  ùê∑ùê∑ = ùëíùëí: ùúñùúñ + ùúíùúíùúéùúé=0. ùê∏ùê∏ (4.1)  ùúéùúé = ‚ÑÇùê∑ùê∑=0: ùúñùúñ ‚àí ùëûùëûùëáùëá. ùê∑ùê∑  ùê∏ùê∏ = ‚àíùëûùëû: ùúñùúñ + ùúíùúíùúéùúé=0 ‚àí1 . ùê∑ùê∑ (4.2)  The fourth-order tensors ‚ÑÇùê∏ùê∏=0 and ‚ÑÇùê∑ùê∑=0 are the elastic stiffness of the material in zero  electric and charge fields, respectively, the second-order tensor ùúíùúíùúéùúé=0 is the electric permittivity  in zero mechanical stress, and the third-order tensors ùëíùëí and ùëûùëû are, respectively, the piezoelectric  coupling coefficients for the Stress-Charge and Stress-Voltage forms, respectively. The Stress- Voltage form can be derived as the partial derivatives of the energy density function  ùëäùëä(ùúñùúñ, ùê∑ùê∑) = 1 2 ùúñùúñ: ‚ÑÇùê∑ùê∑=0: ùúñùúñ ‚àí ùê∑ùê∑. ùëûùëû: ùúñùúñ + 1 2 ùê∑ùê∑. ùúíùúíùúéùúé=0 ‚àí1 . ùê∑ùê∑:         ùúéùúé = ùúïùúïùúïùúï ùúïùúïùúïùúï , ùê∏ùê∏ = ùúïùúïùúïùúï ùúïùúïùê∑ùê∑.  (4.3)  Similarly, by carrying out the partial Legendre transformation, we reach at the enthalpy density  function  ùëäùëä‚àó(ùúñùúñ, ùê∑ùê∑) = ùëñùëñùëñùëñùëñùëñùê∏ùê∏[ùëäùëä(ùúñùúñ, ùê∑ùê∑) ‚àí ùê∑ùê∑. ùê∏ùê∏] = 1 2 ùúñùúñ: ‚ÑÇùê∏ùê∏=0: ùúñùúñ ‚àí ùê∏ùê∏. ùëíùëí: ùúñùúñ + 1 2 ùê∏ùê∏. ùúíùúíùúéùúé=0. ùê∏ùê∏  (4.4)  where  ‚ÑÇùê∑ùê∑=0 = ‚ÑÇùê∏ùê∏=0 ‚àí ùëíùëíùëáùëá. ùúíùúíùúéùúé=0 ‚àí1 . ùëíùëí;        ùëûùëû = ùúíùúíùúéùúé=0 ‚àí1 . ùëíùëí.  (4.5)  As a result, the Stress-Voltage form can be derived by identifying  ùúéùúé = ùúïùúïùúïùúï‚àó ùúïùúïùúïùúï ;        ùê∑ùê∑‚àó ‚âî ‚àíùê∑ùê∑ = ùúïùúïùúïùúï‚àó ùúïùúïùê∏ùê∏ .  (4.6)  From now on, ‚ÑÇ ‚âî ‚ÑÇùê∑ùê∑=0, ‚ÑÇ‚àó ‚âî ‚ÑÇùê∏ùê∏=0, ùúíùúí: = ùúíùúíùúéùúé=0. The problem of material  characterization by homogenization can be described as finding appropriate fields‚Äô functions that  minimize the total energy or enthalpy functional of an RVE or a cell such that they observe the  17    periodic boundary conditions, the mechanical compatibility equation, and Gauss‚Äôs law or  Faraday‚Äôs law, and the averaging conditions. Specifically, an RVE occupying the 3D domain  ‚Ñõ ‚äÇ ‚Ñù3 consists of ùëÅùëÅùëöùëöùëöùëöùëöùëö material phases characterized by ùëäùëä(ùëùùëù) = ùëäùëä(ùëùùëù)(ùúñùúñ, ùê∑ùê∑) and ùëäùëä‚àó(ùëùùëù) = ùëäùëä‚àó(ùëùùëù)(ùúñùúñ, ùê∏ùê∏) each occupying a subdomain ‚Ñõ(ùëùùëù) ‚äÇ ‚Ñõ. Therefore, the electromechancial energy  density of the cell is  ùëäùëä‡µ´ùë•ùë•, ùúñùúñ(ùë•ùë•), ùê∑ùê∑(ùë•ùë•)‡µØ = ‚àë ùëÅùëÅùëöùëöùëöùëöùëöùëö ùúÅùúÅ(ùëùùëù)(ùë•ùë•)ùëäùëä(ùëùùëù)‡µ´ùë•ùë•, ùúñùúñ(ùë•ùë•), ùê∑ùê∑(ùë•ùë•)‡µØ ùëùùëù=1  ‚àÄùë•ùë• ‚àà ‚Ñõ,  (4.7)  where  ùúÅùúÅ(ùëùùëù) = ùúÅùúÅ(ùëùùëù)(ùë•ùë•) is the phase indicator function which maps each position vector to value 1  in ‚Ñõ(ùëùùëù) and 0 otherwise. Considering the volume average of a quantity as ‚å©(‚àô)‚å™ = 1 ‚Ñõ ‚à´ (‚àô)ùëëùëëùëëùëë ‚Ñõ , and  assuming the cell is subject to the macroscopic strain and the macroscopic electric displacement  or the macroscopic electric field, the averaging conditions are  ‚å©ùúñùúñ‚å™ = ùúñùúñÃÖ; ‚å©ùê∑ùê∑‚å™ = ùê∑ùê∑‡¥•; ‚å©ùê∏ùê∏‚å™ = ùê∏ùê∏‡¥§.  (4.8)  Following the derivation of Lippman-Schwinger equations and the Green operators Œì, ùêøùêø, and ùê∫ùê∫,  the equilibrium equations are as follows. For the minimization problem of the energy  formulation, the equations in the real space are  Œì ‚àó ùúéùúé = 0, ùêøùêø ‚àó ùê∏ùê∏ = 0 ‚áî Œìùëñùëñùëñùëñùëñùëñùëñùëñ ‚àó ùúéùúéùëñùëñùëñùëñ = 0, ùêøùêøùëñùëñùëñùëñ ‚àó ùê∏ùê∏ùëñùëñ = 0.  (4.9)  In the Fourier‚Äôs space, they transform into  Œì‡∑†: ùúéùúé‡∑ú = 0, ùêøùêø‡∑†. ùê∏ùê∏‡∑† = 0 ‚áî Œì‡∑†ùëñùëñùëñùëñùëñùëñùëñùëñùúéùúé‡∑úùëñùëñùëñùëñ = 0, ùêøùêø‡∑†ùëñùëñùëñùëñùê∏ùê∏‡∑†ùëñùëñ = 0.  (4.10)  In parallel, for the saddle point problem of the enthalpy formulation, their counterparts are  Œì ‚àó ùúéùúé = 0, ùê∫ùê∫ ‚àó ùê∑ùê∑ = 0 ‚áî Œìùëñùëñùëñùëñùëñùëñùëñùëñ ‚àó ùúéùúéùëñùëñùëñùëñ = 0, ùê∫ùê∫ùëñùëñùëñùëñ ‚àó ùê∑ùê∑ùëñùëñ = 0;  Œì‡∑†: ùúéùúé‡∑ú = 0, ùê∫ùê∫‡∑†. ùê∑ùê∑‡∑° = 0 ‚áî Œì‡∑†ùëñùëñùëñùëñùëñùëñùëñùëñùúéùúé‡∑úùëñùëñùëñùëñ = 0, ùê∫ùê∫‡∑†ùëñùëñùëñùëñùê∑ùê∑ùëñùëñ = 0.  (4.11)  In the energy formulation, if we split the strain field and the electric displacement vector into the  sum of their average or macroscopic fields and the fluctuation ones as ùúñùúñ = ùúñùúñÃÖ + ùúñùúñÃÉ, ùê∑ùê∑ = ùê∑ùê∑‡¥• + ùê∑ùê∑‡∑©,  18    the aforementioned equilibrium equations lead to  Œì ‚àó ‡µ´‚ÑÇ: ùúñùúñÃÉ ‚àí ùëûùëûùëáùëá. ùê∑ùê∑‡∑©‡µØ = ‚àíŒì ‚àó (‚ÑÇ: ùúñùúñÃÖ ‚àí ùëûùëûùëáùëá. ùê∑ùê∑‡¥•);  L ‚àó ‡µ´‚àíùëûùëû. ùúñùúñÃÉ + ùúíùúí‚àí1. ùê∑ùê∑‡∑©‡µØ = ‚àíL ‚àó (‚àíùëûùëû. ùúñùúñÃÖ + ùúíùúí‚àí1. ùê∑ùê∑‡¥•).  (4.12)  This linear system of equations for the solution fields ùúñùúñÃÉ and ùê∑ùê∑‡∑© must be supplemented with the  averaging conditions ‚å©ùúñùúñÃÉ ‚å™ = 0 and ‚å©ùê∑ùê∑‡∑©‚å™ = 0. The right-hand sides are known given the applied  macroscopic boundary conditions or the input arguments of the solution algorithm, ùúñùúñÃÖ and ùê∑ùê∑‡¥•. By  applying Fourier transforms and then inverse Fourier transforms, we have an equivalent system  of equations  ‚Ñ±‚àí1{Œì‡∑†: ‚Ñ±‡µ£‚ÑÇ: ùúñùúñÃÉ ‚àí ùëûùëûùëáùëá. ùê∑ùê∑‡∑©‡µß} = ‚àí‚Ñ±‚àí1{Œì‡∑†: ‚Ñ±[‚ÑÇ: ùúñùúñÃÖ ‚àí ùëûùëûùëáùëá. ùê∑ùê∑‡¥•]};  ‚àí‚Ñ±‚àí1{L‡∑†: ‚Ñ±‡µ£‚àíùëûùëû. ùúñùúñÃÉ + ùúíùúí‚àí1. ùê∑ùê∑‡∑©‡µß} = ‚àí‚Ñ±‚àí1{L‡∑†: ‚Ñ±[‚àíùëûùëû. ùúñùúñÃÖ + ùúíùúí‚àí1. ùê∑ùê∑‡¥•]},  (4.13)  that can be solved by a conjugate-gradient solver since the left-hand side can be thought of as the  effect of the linear operators of ùúñùúñÃÉ, ùê∑ùê∑‡∑© and the right-hand side is a given computable vector.  Consequently, the system can be viewed as ùê¥ùê¥ùë•ùë• = ùëèùëè, where ùê¥ùê¥ùë•ùë• represents the entire linear  operator and is computed in a matrix-free fashion. We consider  ‚Äñùëèùëè‚àíùê¥ùê¥ùê¥ùê¥‚Äñ ‚Äñùëèùëè‚Äñ < ùëáùëáùëáùëáùêøùêø as the stopping  criterion of the iterative solver with TOL given by the user. Similarly, the corresponding Fourier  equations for the enthalpy formulation are  ‚Ñ±‚àí1{Œì‡∑†: ‚Ñ±[‚ÑÇ‚àó: ùúñùúñÃÉ ‚àí ùëíùëíùëáùëá. ùê∏ùê∏‡∑®]} = ‚àí‚Ñ±‚àí1{Œì‡∑†: ‚Ñ±[‚ÑÇ‚àó: ùúñùúñÃÖ ‚àí ùëíùëíùëáùëá. ùê∏ùê∏‡¥§]};  ‚àí‚Ñ±‚àí1{G‡∑°: ‚Ñ±[‚àíùëíùëí. ùúñùúñÃÉ ‚àí ùúíùúí. ùê∏ùê∏‡∑®]} = ‚àí‚Ñ±‚àí1{G‡∑°: ‚Ñ±[‚àíùëíùëí. ùúñùúñÃÖ ‚àí ùúíùúí. ùê∏ùê∏‡¥§]},  (4.14)  Note that equation ùê∫ùê∫ ‚àó ùê∑ùê∑‚àó = ‚àíùê∫ùê∫ ‚àó ùê∑ùê∑ = 0 is solved instead of the original ùê∫ùê∫ ‚àó ùê∑ùê∑ = 0 so  that the left-hand side has a symmetric matrix ùê¥ùê¥. Nevertheless, this is resulted from the saddle- point variational problem, and it cannot be solved by standard CG solver easily. To this end, we  used the Minimum Residual Method to solve the system for the enthalpy formulation.  19    Considering the symmetries in our derivation, the number of required operations to solve the  Fourier equations and find the homogenized properties is almost halved compared with  conventional methods described in the literature. That is especially crucial in the real-world  applicability of our data-driven design framework by having the most robust numerical  homogenizer for material characterization. Following the selection of microstructures in the  dataset discussed in the previous section, we performed FFT homogenization simulations given  their images (geometrical material phase information) to find their linear electromechanical  properties. For each microstructure, nine different far-field unit load cases were solved to find  the homogenized composite property matrices since the linear property matrix is nine by nine in  the most general case. The orthotropic constituent properties, in the Stress-Charge form, are  calculated as follows:  ‚é£ ‚é¢ ‚é¢ ‚é¢ ‚é¢ ‚é¢ ‚é¢ ‚é¢ ‚é° ùúéùúé11 ùúéùúé22 ùúéùúé33 ùúéùúé23 ùúéùúé13 ùúéùúé12 ùê∑ùê∑1 ùê∑ùê∑2 ùê∑ùê∑3‚é¶ ‚é• ‚é• ‚é• ‚é• ‚é• ‚é• ‚é• ‚é§ = ‚é£ ‚é¢ ‚é¢ ‚é¢ ‚é¢ ‚é¢ ‚é¢ ‚é¢ ‚é°ùê∂ùê∂11 ùê∂ùê∂12 ùê∂ùê∂13 0 0 0 0 0 ‚àíùëíùëí31 ùê∂ùê∂12 ùê∂ùê∂11 ùê∂ùê∂13 0 0 0 0 0 ‚àíùëíùëí31 ùê∂ùê∂13 ùê∂ùê∂13 ùê∂ùê∂33 0 0 0 0 0 ‚àíùëíùëí33 0 0 0 ùê∂ùê∂44 0 0 0 ‚àíùëíùëí15 0 0 0 0 0 ùê∂ùê∂44 0 ‚àíùëíùëí15 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ùê∂ùê∂66 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ùëíùëí15 0 ùõæùõæ11 0 0 0 0 0 ùëíùëí15 0 0 0 ùõæùõæ11 0 ùëíùëí31 ùëíùëí31 ùëíùëí33 0 0 0 0 0 ùõæùõæ33 ‚é¶ ‚é• ‚é• ‚é• ‚é• ‚é• ‚é• ‚é• ‚é§ . ‚é£ ‚é¢ ‚é¢ ‚é¢ ‚é¢ ‚é¢ ‚é¢ ‚é¢ ‚é° ùúÄùúÄ11 ùúÄùúÄ22 ùúÄùúÄ33 ùúÄùúÄ23 ùúÄùúÄ13 ùúÄùúÄ12 ùê∏ùê∏1 ùê∏ùê∏2 ùê∏ùê∏3‚é¶ ‚é• ‚é• ‚é• ‚é• ‚é• ‚é• ‚é• ‚é§ .  (4.15)  The composite property matrices were then post-processed such that only the 11  prominent components, as defined in the orthotropic property matrix above, were extracted as  the continuous label vectors for each microstructure. The Figure 4.6 results show a high level of  variation in the calculated properties as the range of variation with respect to the average values  is between 0.02 and 6.38. To facilitate the ML training process, these label vectors were  normalized such that the average and the variance of each property component is zero and one,  respectively.  20      Figure 4.6. The range of homogenized properties variation with respect to their average values in  the homogenized microstructures.  1.5.  TransVNet, a New Robust ML Model to Find SP Links  The cornerstone of our design methodology is our new machine-learning framework  called TransVNet. At a high level, the goal of microstructure optimization is achieved by  creating two nonlinear maps: (a) the forward problem, which maps a given microstructure (e.g., a  two-phase microstructure) to a specific set of properties, and (b) the inverse problem which, for a  given target set of properties, produces a microstructure with the desired properties. However,  both the forward problem, which typically requires solving coupled nonlinear partial differential  equations (PDEs), and the inverse problem, which involves solving a PDE-constrained nonlinear  optimization problem, are computationally challenging. The current morphology optimization  approaches are heavily reliant on multiple forward-model PDE calculations. Therefore, there is  an urgent need for ML approaches that can efficiently and accurately solve both the forward and  inverse problems in a single setting. Our proposed TransVNet network (illustrated in Figure 7)  addresses this challenge. We aim to approximate the forward and inverse maps using deep  generative models, a new type of neural network widely used in content generation, image  translation, and style transfer, among other applications [65‚Äì67]. However, their application in  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 min/avg max/avg std/avg 21    engineering design, materials design (especially heterogeneous microstructural design), and  scientific computing has not been explored to the extent of their capabilities in literature.     Figure 4.7. Schematic diagram of our proposed ML method, TransVNet, for material design.  Our proposed TransVNet, inspired by TransUNet [46], is suitable for 3D image and  mixed-format data, which is the case for the current study as the best way to work with  heterogeneous microstructures is to work with their images, not just limited expert-picked  features such as its auto-correlation statistics. We also did not choose to use TransUNet or  similar 2D networks on the stack of 2D images as it cannot fully exploit the 3D relationships  between different volumetric microstructural regions. Furthermore, our new TransVNet will be  semi-supervised in that its decoder will be used as a generative model for material design  22    following the training of the whole network consisting of its encoder and its decoder. To the best  of authors‚Äô knowledge, this is the first generative model for the material design that leverages the  state-of-the-art ViTs in computer vision. Other notable differences are our customized CNN  feature extractor in the encoder instead of pre-trained CNNs (such as ResNet [68] as used in  TransUNet [69]) since there is no pre-trained CNN for 3D images, its capability to include expert  knowledge in the embeddings fed to the ViT which can improve the performance of the network  and minimize the training costs, and considering a composite loss function since the network is a  variational autoencoder for the purpose of material design.

The vectorized patches ùë•ùë•ùëùùëù ùëñùëñ  are then projected into a D(= 72 in this study)- dimensional embedding space by learnable linear transformation, ùê∏ùê∏ ‚àà ‚Ñù(ùëÉùëÉ3.ùê∂ùê∂‚Ä≤)√óùê∑ùê∑.

To avoid information loss in low-level features  such as the shape and the boundary of the material phases, and to improve the accuracy of the  network in inference, a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture constitutes the encoder.

Our latent information  mixing is unconventional as we consider each property component or label feature as the  attenuation or bias parameter for a single information channel of the final latent variable fed into  the decoder as the generative model.

The cascaded upsampler consists of decoder  blocks with a trilinear upsampler succeeded by two ReLU activated convolutional layers.  Following some experiments, a single CUP led to poor performance on some test cases related to  vastly different volume fraction ranges. Therefore, the final network has seven CUP heads  dedicated to different volume fraction ranges to improve the general network performance.   The generated dataset was split into two sets: training dataset consisting of 85% of  samples and testing or evaluation dataset. The training results in Figure 4.8 show that the loss  values have decreased through back-propagation optimization via ADAM optimizer such that  they have reached an almost stationary state. The fluctuations are due to the cyclic multiplier of  the KL divergence loss as discussed above. This multiplier, taking values between zero and one,  is displayed inside the figure as a function of the number of training epochs. In this training trial,  the number of epochs is 200, and each epoch takes 9 iterations to go over the whole training  dataset. To assess the performance of the trained model, the unseen test dataset was used. The  labels, i.e., property vectors, were given to the decoder alongside a random sample of the  isotropic normal distribution. The generated images were then fed into the trained encoder as the  fast surrogate of the FFT homogenizer to estimate the properties of the designed microstructures  and compare them with the values obtained from FFT homogenization in the test dataset. The  regression plots for two important properties according to the application of the studied material  system (flexible sensors) were drawn to assess the level of accuracy of the surrogate model,  shown in Figure 4.9(a) for the C33 stiffness property and in Figure 4.9(b) for the e33  piezoelectric property, as well as the material designer, shown in Figure 4.9(a) for the C33  stiffness property and in Figure 4.9(b) for the e33 piezoelectric property. The ideal result  26    associated with maximum accuracy is when all data points are located on ùë¶ùë¶ = ùë•ùë• line. Therefore,  it can be inferred from the plots and ùëÖùëÖ2 values that the models are generally accurate except  where the underlying property manifold has not been explored equally in our generated dataset,  i.e., the high-volume fraction regions. Despite this lower level of accuracy, the models are still  capable of finding the solutions qualitatively.    Figure 4.8. The training loss values and KL annealing scheduler.

Experimental validation  Collaboration with The University of Iowa‚Äôs AMPRL Lab provided the fabrication  process for the tested samples, based on a process from part literature [72]. A patented support- free ceramic AM technology, i.e., suspension-enclosing projection stereolithography [73] was  utilized to fabricate piezoelectric ceramic-polymer composites.   28    The feedstock material for printing consisted of a ceramic powder, a combination of  photocurable resins, and a dispersant. For exceptional dielectric properties, barium titanate  (BaTiO3, < 2‚Äâ¬µm, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) was selected as the model ceramic  material at a concentration of 70 wt%. Two commercial resins were selected with desirable  photosensitivity at concentrations of 15 wt%. Formlabs resin (FLGPCL01, Formlabs, Boston,  USA) and 15 wt% Anycubic resin (white, ANYCUBIC, Shenzhen, China). To unify the particle  distribution, Solsperse 20000 (Lubrizol, United Kingdom, Europe) was chosen as the dispersant  at 1 wt% of the final composition. Materials were manually mixed to visible uniformity and then  ran in a planetary ball mill for 2 hours at 300 RPM to ensure the slurry was truly homogeneous.  For final preparations, the slurry was degassed in vacuum at -1.5 bar for 30 minutes.  In short, the process enables the support-free fabrication of piezoceramic components  with complex overhanging structures by harnessing an elasto-viscoplastic ceramic suspension  feedstock and a meniscus-backflow-based layer-recoating method. A schematic of the printing  process is shown in Figure 4.10, provided by Li et. al [73]. The suspension contains  photopolymer binder which is cured in a layerwise fashion by a UV projector on the  stereolithography process. An image of a projected layer is provided in Figure 4.11(a) which  comes from a sliced layer of a CAD model. The projector not only cures the image in the  suspension in the x-y direction, but also penetrates in the z-direction to bond each layer together.  Following the printing process, the UV-cured structure is cleaned of any excess suspension, as  shown in Figure 4.11(b). Once printed, the green composite contains significant amounts of  photopolymer resin. Using a tube furnace (STF150, Carbolite-Gero LLC, Hope Valley, UK), the  printed part was fired at 600 ÷Øùê∂ùê∂ for 3 hours under Argon to decompose the resin. The residue char  remained to bond the BTO particles. Following debinding, the parts were placed in a regular  29    muffle furnace (HTF18, Carbolite-Gero LLC, Hope Valley, UK) at 1330‚Äâ¬∞C for 240‚Äâmin. Once  finished sintering, the final part was a fully dense and organic ceramic. Sintered parts were taped  on one end to ensure polymer did not coat the testing surface. Following, they were placed in an  FDM printed cubic vessel. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), an elastomer, was directed into the  vessel using a syringe until the polymer reached the top surface of the ceramic, without  breaching the surface. The FDM vessel was placed in vacuum for 10 minutes to ensure the  polymer had reached all cavities within the complex structure. The sample during the infiltration  process and once removed from the vessel is shown in Figure 4.11(c). Excess polymer was cut  from the ceramic presenting the final part tested (Figure 4.11(d)).

The process for polymer infiltrated ceramics include (a) printing, (b) green  structures, (c) polymer infiltration, and (d) the final part.  In this research, ùëëùëë33 was measured using a piezoelectric charge constant meter (PKD3- 2000, PolyK Technologies LLC, Philipsburg, USA) at a force-frequency of 110 Hz. The  piezoelectric voltage constant was calculated via the equation ùëîùëî33 = ùëëùëë33/…õùë£ùë£…õ0. Dielectric  Permittivity was calculated via …õ33 = …õùë£ùë£…õ0, where ùúÄùúÄ0 = 8.854 √ó 10‚àí12 ùêπùêπ/ùëöùëö is the permittivity  of air, and …õùë£ùë£ is the relative permittivity of the measured material [72]. The …õùë£ùë£ and tanùõøùõø were  measured using an LCR meter (TG2811D, TONGHUI, Changzhou China) at 1 kHz frequency,  signal source output resistance of 100‚Ñ¶, a signal level of 1.0 V, and a parallel equivalent circuit.  For preparation, the samples were lightly coated on the top and bottom surface with Nickel  conductive paint (MG Chemicals, Ontario Canada) to ensure maximum conductivity. The  31    relative permeability and loss tangent for all 4 samples were calculated. The experimental results  are shown in Table 4.2. The FFT homogenization of the CAD model from which the  experimental samples were synthesized is as follows: (ùúÄùúÄùë£ùë£)33 = ùõæùõæ33 ùúÄùúÄ0 = 250.14; ùëëùëë33 = ùëíùëí33(ùê∂ùê∂‚àí1)33 = 122.3 ùëùùëùùê∂ùê∂ ùëÅùëÅ . Therefore, our homogenization method resulted in satisfactory  estimation of the physical properties based on the average measurements.  Table 4.2.

Conclusions  In this study, we have proposed a universal methodology to design multifunctional  heterogeneous or microstructural materials based on several novel computational methods  validated with the experimental results for the specific application of flexible composites of  ceramic-embedded plastics. Our first method was HetMiGen to realize different geometrical  possibilities for heterogeneous microstructures, especially the cellular or bincontinous ones with  superior properties in flexible piezocomposites, without any need to experimental data. Its results  indicate its versatility and computational efficiency using C++ parallel programming. We  selected a balanced dataset from its results for optimum training. We developed our efficient  FFT homogenizer to find the effective composite properties of the selected dataset. Its results  showed the vast design possibilities by the level of variation in each property component. The  cornerstone of our methodology is our 3D and long-range inferring deep learner, called  32    TransVNet, based on the state-of-the-arts in the computer vision field as well as our customized  architecture for its physics-aware applications, including our current static design problem. The  network is a variational autoencoder so that its trained encoder acts as the fast surrogate of costly  numerical properties homogenizer, such as the FFT one in this study, and its trained decoder  performs the generative design process given target properties, which is challenging due to the  very large number of design variables (643 in our trial) and the complexity of the multiphysics  properties manifold as each material phase contributes to a specific desired property in the  composite. Nevertheless, our results show high accuracy of the surrogate model as well as  satisfactory performance of the material designer. This material designer is also advantageous  compared with other conventional methods since it can be constantly improved by providing  more data in the future through transfer learning and used almost instantaneously or online in  contrast with optimization-based methods. As seen in the regression plots for the case study, the  property manifold has not been explored in balance, and the designer accuracy may be improved  by generating more diverse set of high-volume fraction microstructures. The current study is  computational yet purely data-driven resulting in the valuable byproduct of in-silico generated  dataset of different material microstructures labeled with their multifunctional properties as well  as the trained network, all expandable in future studies for other material systems and  applications. Also, our computational framework has been built considering the future problems  such as context-aware learning, e.g., the physical and manufacturing constraints as terms of the  loss function, and dynamic or sequential property learning, e.g., the electrical properties as  functions of frequency. Lastly, we presented the experimental details of the additive  manufacturing technique used to make the studied material system. Although the results point to  a strong link between our computational framework and the real-world application, future studies  33    should focus on decreasing the mismatch between these two and increasing the repeatability with  lower variations of the composite properties among synthesized samples of a given  microstructure geometry.
