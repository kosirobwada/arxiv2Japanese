Due to the \nmultiphysics interactions of the studied material system, we have developed an accurate and \nefficient FFT-based numerical method to find the multifunctional properties of diverse cellular \nmicrostructures generated by our HetMiGen code. To mine this big dataset, we used our \ncustomized physics-aware generative neural network in the format of a VAE with convolutional \nneural layers augmented by a vision transformer to learn long-distance features which may affect \nthe properties of the 3D voxelized microstructures.

They can be used in a range of applications such as lightweight thermo-\nstructural panels, blast resistant structures, high-authority morphing components [2], structural \nsensors [3], wearable electronics [4], and energy harvesters [5‚Äì7]. Integrating various properties \nand functions within a single piece of material simplifies manufacturing and reduces cost. \nAdditive manufacturing (AM) allows precise control over materials‚Äô geometry, composition, and \nmorphology [8‚Äì11]. While this has led to the development of materials with single properties, \nthere has been little exploration of using microstructure to design manufacturable multifunctional \nmaterials. Designing microstructural materials with simultaneous multiple optimum properties, \nsuch as piezoelectric composites [12‚Äì14] with excellent piezoelectricity and flexibility, is a much \nmore challenging task than designing materials based on a single property. Existing single-\nfunction design strategies suffer from several limitations, including (1) a lack of accurate and fast \nphysical models for predicting material behavior, (2) high costs or morphological limitations of \nin-silico microstructure generation techniques, (3) multiple expensive offline optimization cycles \nfor different target performances, (4) lack of modularity and generality to tackle diverse design \nproblems, (5) reliance on purely data-driven approaches limited to the locality of convolutional \noperators in deep learners, (6) and imperfect translation of abstract designs into actual products \n3 \n \ndue to manufacturing uncertainties and limitations. In this research effort, we aimed to develop a \nnovel machine learning (ML)-driven design framework that can transform the current paradigm \nof material development into a more efficient and effective approach for designing \nmanufacturable microstructural materials with desirable multifunctional properties. To achieve \nthis goal, we pursued four objectives summarized in Figure 4.1: (1) developing a universal and \nfast in-silico voxelized microstructure generator, (2) developing accurate and rapid numerical \nhomogenization methods for microstructural materials to obtain multifunctional and mechanical \nproperties, (3) establishing bi-directional structure-property relationships by training our novel \nML model (TransVNet) to handle sequential properties and physical constraints, and (4) \nvalidating the framework by manufacturing and characterizing designed microstructural \nmaterials using AM. \n  \n \nMachine Learning \nNovel ML model-TransVNet- \nfor PSP links and design \n \nDatabase Generation \n \nUnique database of \nvoxelized microstructural materials \nFFT  \nHomogenization \n \nÔÉò Piezoelectric \nÔÉò Dielectric \nÔÉò Stiffness \n3D Peridynamics  \nDamage Model \n \nÔÉò Fracture Behavior \nÔÉò Strength \nNovel Additive \nManufacturing\n \n \nExperimental \nCharacterization \n \nDielectric  \n Performance \n \n \nMechanical \nPerformance \n \nPiezoelectric \n Performance \n \n \nOptimum Design \n \n4 \n \nFigure 4.1. Interactive design loop of our proposed methodology for multifunctional \nmicrostructural materials. \nSince microstructural material morphology influences its properties [15,16], finding the \ntarget morphology has been the focus of many studies in the field of material design. To \neffectively explore the design space, it is crucial to employ appropriate methods. Microstructure \ndesign methods developed based on the rich microstructure characterization and reconstruction \nliterature [17] are limited to some target exemplars from experiments [18‚Äì20] or involve \nexpensive simulations [21,22] and cannot be used for different material systems. For example, \ndescriptor-based methods may be used only for particulate composites, not heterogeneous ones \n[23,24]. Furthermore, material design methods that focus on optimizing a high-resolution \nmicrostructure or a massive number of design variables usually require many candidate \nmicrostructures with significantly varied features to converge to the best possible solution. This, \nin turn, calls for a fast and efficient microstructure generation method. These two gaps in the \ncurrent state-of-the-art motivated us to propose a new method for heterogeneous microstructure \ngeneration (HetMiGen) to artificially generate 3D microstructures with no need for reference 2D \nimages of physical material. The core ideas for our proposed algorithm stem from previous \nstudies on developing statistical microstructure reconstruction techniques for materials [25‚Äì29]. \nHetMiGen provides distinct capabilities not present in other synthetic microstructure generators, \nsuch as Dream3D [30]. While Dream3D is limited to producing polycrystalline microstructures, \nHetMiGen enables the controlled inclusion of various shapes and distributions, including \nanisotropy and cellular morphology. The details of our new algorithm and its computational \nimplementation are discussed in section 4.3. \nTo complete the data generation for our material design methodology, an efficient \ncomputational homogenizer is needed to find effective material properties. Considering 3D \n5 \n \nvoxelized microstructure models with N grid points per dimension, the computational effort for \nFFT simulations scales with ùëÅùëÅ log ùëÅùëÅ, which is much more efficient than the ùëÅùëÅ3 scaling observed \nin FEM simulations. Therefore, we have developed FFT simulation codes to numerically solve \nthe governing PDE equations of the homogenization problem. There has been a strong interest in \ndeveloping FFT computational methods for multifunctional and multi-phase composite \nmaterials. However, for piezoelectricity, the methods available in the literature [31,32] are not \nsuitable to converge to the solution in the heterogeneous microstructures whose phase boundaries \nare complex and irregular, and the property contrast ratio of composite constituents is high. Also, \nthe enthalpy formulation found in the previous FFT work [31,32] leads to a saddle-point \nvariational minimization problem which is more challenging to solve than the convex variational \nminimization via the energy formulation of the constitutive laws. Our homogenization method is \nexplained in section 4.4.  \nComputational material design has emerged as a promising approach to accelerate the \ndiscovery of new materials with tailored properties and functions. Traditionally, material \nknowledge has been explored using physics-based Process-Structure-Properties (PSP) models \nand/or experiments in the forward direction (from process to structure to properties). However, \nmaterial design inherently drives discovery in the inverse direction, which requires the \nestablishment of reduced-order PSP linkages [33,34] using regression or statistical learning \ntechniques on data produced by PSP models and physical experiments. Alternatively, novel \nmining techniques may be used on the big data generated [22,35‚Äì37] through accurate and \nefficient computational models with limited experimental calibrations and validations. The \nsecond route is more suitable for material systems in which the process is directly linked to the \nmaterial‚Äôs structure via advanced additive manufacturing [38,39] in mesoscale or traditional \n6 \n \ncomputer numerical control (CNC) machining of a topology-optimized (TO) structure in macro-\nscale [40‚Äì42]. However, TO [43] methods lack the generalizability of the newer computational \nmethods based on generative models in ML [22,36,37] since they solve the optimization problem \nfor each user-specified set of goals and constraints. In contrast, the ML-based ones are trained \nonce and then used in the inference mode almost instantly with much less computational cost. At \nthe same time, TOs are more computationally demanding even for one target property due to \ntheir dependency on FEM. Although purely convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become \nwidespread in ML-based methods, they lack an understanding of the input image's long-range \nrelationships due to the intrinsic locality of convolution operators, resulting in a weak \nperformance for structures with a large inter-sample variation. That is where Transformers [44] \ncame into play by leveraging their self-attention mechanisms. However, their naive use may lead \nto poor results as they focus exclusively on the global contexts of 1D sequences. Recent research \nhas demonstrated superior performance by combining Vision Transformers (ViTs) [45] with \nCNN feature extractors [46]. Building upon these advancements, our network (TransVNet) \ndirectly works with 3D voxelized microstructures instead of stacks of 2D slices and is most \nbeneficial when the quantities of interest are affected by long-range voxel/phase relationships \nthat are not captured by the local convolutional operators used in CNNs. It will also be useful \nwhen those quantities are sequential and inputs are in a mixed format, which are challenging to \nencode using current material design methods. The network has been developed such that \nphysics and context constraints can be considered invariances in training, following the rise of \nphysics-informed networks [47] in scientific machine learning. This will make the computational \nframework more efficient and modular for more complex future applications while avoiding \n7 \n \nusing data-hungry deep learners commonly used in computational materials science. The \nnetwork and its relation to material design is discussed in section 4.5. \nPolymer-ceramic composites have tremendous potential for multifunctional devices, such \nas energy harvesting devices (e.g., wearable electronics and healthcare sensors) [48] and high-\nfrequency antennas [49], as they come with tunable and advantageous mechanical properties \nsuch as high compliances, toughness, and yield strains. However, the polymer-ceramic \ncomposites with randomly dispersed ceramic particles have poor piezoelectric properties [50] \n(Figure 4.2(a)). Furthermore, the polymer-ceramic composite of 1‚Äì3 has superb energy \nharvesting properties only in the fiber direction (Figure 4.2(b)). To overcome these challenges, \nthe mesoscale geometry of composites should be optimized by tailoring the ceramic phase \nmorphologies. In recent years, there has been an increased interest in developing 3‚Äì3 (Figure \n4.2(c)) complex geometry of composites, for example, 3D interconnected composites with \ncontinuous ceramic skeletons that possess superb energy harvesting [51,52]. Also, this material \nsystem is suitable for high-frequency antenna applications (such as 5G), and the morphology \nsignificantly affects the electric permittivity and loss in different frequency ranges. A \nconsiderable challenge of fabricating such composites is to precisely control the complicated \nmesoscale geometry featured by the randomness and interconnectivity of the interfaces and \nachieve the desired functional properties in the final structures. With the merits of dealing with \ncomplex geometries, additive manufacturing has been widely studied and applied to fabricate \npolymer-ceramic composites [52,53]. There have been a few efforts to numerically generate this \nkind of geometries [54,55]. However, such constructed geometries can still not guarantee fiber \nmorphology and interconnectivity [54]. A few studies have been devoted to the topological \noptimization of piezoelectric structures [56‚Äì58]; however, our proposed design methodology \n8 \n \ndoes not have the conventional restriction of the TO methods mentioned above. With these \ninsights, we have systematically investigated the effect of mesoscale geometry on stiffness, \npiezoelectric, and dielectric properties of flexible polymer-ferroelectric composites.  \nFurthermore, we designed these material systems for target performances using our new deep \ngenerative network. This network has been trained on the dataset comprising various cellular \nmorphologies generated through our HetMiGen algorithm and their corresponding homogenized \nmultiphysics properties obtained using our high-fidelity/accurate fast FFT method. The details of \nmanufacturing and experimental characterization are discussed in section 4.6. To show the \ncapabilities of our proposed methodology framework, we have run our computational codes and \nvalidated them based on the PDMS-BTO material system with PDMS/matrix and BTO/inclusion \nproperties obtained from [59,60] and [61], respectively. We experimentally measured the \npiezoelectric and dielectric properties of multiple samples synthesized based on a microstructure \nin our in-silico generated dataset to validate our computational results. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \nFigure 4.2. Effect of geometry on the shear stress distribution in polymer-PZT composites, (a) 0‚Äì\n3 particles; (b)1‚Äì3 cylinders; (c) 3‚Äì3 interconnected [50]. \n1.3. \nHetMiGen generating a novel virtual database of cellular microstructures \nA fast and computationally efficient program, called HetMiGen (short for Heterogeneous \nMicrostructure Generator), has been developed to artificially generate 3D heterogeneous \nmicrostructures without the need to any reference 2D cut section images of physical material \n9 \n \nmicrostructures through expensive experimental methods such as SEM. This in-silico data \ngeneration is especially useful for computational materials science since it does not rely on the \nreconstruction techniques based on some expensive experiments, let alone the physically \nmaterial processing complications with the shortcoming of not being able to consider all the \ndesign space for material design purposes. The C++ source codes can be compiled for and \ndeployed on different machines with Linux or Windows OSs, and the executable can be readily \nrun given a CSV file whose each line contains the microstructural parameters of the \nmicrostructure to be generated: the microstructure id number, the number of phases in addition to \nthe background phase, the volume fraction of each phase, the number of initial seeds, the \nincrement (positive or negative) of seeds‚Äô addition in the next seed addition iterations, the \nfrequency by which seeds are added, the radius of the local neighborhood to be checked for \nproximity for each phase (zero means no check is needed and seeds can be grown until they \ntouch others), whether each phase should be clustered at the end, the rate of growth decay for \neach phase (zero means that growth parameters are fixed throughout the evolution iterations), \nand the probabilistic growth thresholds for Cellular Automate [62] based on the considered \nneighborhood type (von Neumann in the current version of the codes). By changing the input \nparameters, it can generate multitudes of heterogenous microstructures of different material \nsystems consisting of two or more material phases with different morphologies. The parameters \nhave affinity to the physical process of manufacturing and thermomechanical evolution of \nmicrostructure as well. \nAlthough the program is efficient in its serial implementation (e.g., generating a \nbincontinous 1503 resolution microstructure in around two minutes normally), for massive data \ngeneration in ML/data-driven material science, the codes have been written using parallel \n10 \n \nprogramming techniques of OpenMP for single HPC nodes or workstations (shared memory \narchitectures) and OpenMPI for multiple HPC nodes or cloud computing servers (heterogenous \nmemory architectures). Due to loop-carried dependencies and to minimize communication \noverheads, task parallelization through SPMD style of programming was implemented to gain \nspeed-up by dividing microstructure generation tasks into a pool of processors. To demonstrate \nthe speed-up gain, 32 identical input data with the same seeding of random generators were \nconsidered so that the computational loads are balanced among all processors and between \ndifferent configurations (from 16 cores to one core). A decent speed-up in each step was \nachieved as shown in Figure 4.3 for the OpenMP version. The imperfection may be attributed to \nthe thread management (forking and joining) and memory contention on the CPU cache level. \n \nFigure 4.3. Speed-up for different configurations in a log-log scale. \nAs shown in the algorithm flowchart of Figure 4.4, HetMiGen algorithm is based on two \nbasic mechanisms and an addendum to create the special type of microstructures with clustered \nphases such as bincontinous or cellular ones: Seed Addition, Seed Growth, and Clustering. \nDuring Seed Addition, if the current iteration is designated for such operations according to the \nfrequency of seed addition, at most as many as the current number of seed addition, which is the \n256\n512\n1024\n2048\n4096\n1\n2\n4\n8\n16\nComputation time (s)\nNumber of used processors (cores)\n11 \n \nsummation of the previous number of seeds and the increment parameter, are dispersed in the \ncuboid domain of the microstructure according to the quasirandom Sobol sequence [63] for \nuniform dispersion in 3D space. Proximity Check1 means that the chosen seed position which \nshould be an empty voxel (encoded with the background color) can turn into a phase voxel \n(encoded with a pre-designated foreground color) if its neighbors in a r-radius neighborhood, \nwith r being one of the input parameters, are all empty. In the top right 2D image of the figure, \nthe white pixels are the current empty or background ones, the dark blue ones are the seeds \nwhich have been added before the current stage of Seed Growth for that image, and the light blue \nones are the pixels grown according to cellular automata. Therefore, there is an iterative process \nof seed addition in each iteration of the microstructure evolution until all current number of seeds \nare added, or the process proves to be stagnant following an exhaustive search for the right \nposition of the last seed. Immediately after this part, the cells will be grown probabilistically in \ndifferent directions according to a cellular automata algorithm and the chosen neighborhood type \nlike the von Neumann one shown by the cross-hatched pixels of the 2D image. The thresholds \nfor the probabilistic growths are calculated as the decay factor times the initial threshold, and the \nrandom trial for each neighborhood voxel is simulated by the pseudo-random number generator \nMT19937 (Mersenne Twister) [64] resulting in a float number between 0 and 1 drawn from a \nuniform distribution in every function call. So larger thresholds in each direction mean higher \nchances of growth in that direction leading to different levels and directions of anisotropy in the \nfinal evolved microstructure. In Seed Growth, Next interface voxel is a phase voxel which has at \nleast one empty voxel in its immediate von Neumann neighborhood, which can be considered as \na potential location to perform Cellular Automata. Proximity Check2 is similar to Proximity \nCheck1 except that the empty condition is appended by an alternative: if the voxels in its local \n12 \n \nneighborhood all belong to the same cluster of phase voxels (called a cell hereafter). After each \niteration of Seed Growth, the volume fraction of each foreground phase is calculated. If they are \nclose to the target input parameters within an acceptable tolerance, the program will be \nterminated by converting the binary data of the last evolution of the microstructure into 8-bit \nBMP images, as shown by the post-processed/smoothed image of the 3D bone microstructure in \nthe figure. Another alternative for termination is that if the evolution has been stagnant, i.e., there \nhas been no increase in current volume fractions after 5 evolution iterations, the program is \nfailed, and it will attempt to regenerate by starting the random sequences (Sobol for seed \npositioning and MT19937 for seed growth) with another seeding number. If the failure persists \nafter five trials, the program will move on to generate the next requested microstructure. \nIf a foreground phase should be clustered according to the input parameters, the volume \nfraction check will be done based on a lower volume fraction target (85%) to let the clustering \nalgorithm work with current cells by connecting them and adding more foreground phase voxels. \nThe clustering algorithm tries to connect the isolated cells of the grown seeds where they are \nclose to each other by passing through all empty voxels, checking whether at least two isolated \ncells of the material phase to be clustered are present in the local r-radius neighborhood of the \ncurrent empty voxel, and turning all the empty voxels in the neighborhood into the phase color if \nat least two isolated cells are found, and the measured phase density in the local neighborhood is \nhigher than the threshold in the current iteration. This process is also iterative in that the phase \ndensity threshold is incrementally decreased to prioritize connections where the cells are closest \nto each other, and if the density threshold cannot be further lowered (i.e., zero), the radius of the \nlocal neighborhood for density measurement is increased. The iterative algorithm is terminated if \n13 \n \nthe volume fraction goes out of a tolerance band around the requested volume fraction, or if \nmore than 90% of the phase voxels are connected to each other. \nAs mentioned in the introduction, the design space of heterogeneous or cellular \nmicrostructures is huge as each voxel of 1503-resolution 3D image can be attributed to a single \nmaterial phase. Since our design methodology is based on machine learning to find the complex \nbi-directional structure-property mappings, we generated a big dataset of bincontinous or cellular \nmicrostructures, represented by their 2D slice images, to consider different morphological \npossibilities and to train our network on a highly diverse and inclusive dataset. Therefore, a list \nof different HetMiGen input parameters, including different volume fraction numbers and \nanisotropy and dispersion/seed numbers, was generated according to Sobol sequence within \nranges specified by the physical constraints and sensitivity analysis in the code results. As \nillustrated in Figure 4.5, the resulting dataset was skewed despite the maximum dispersion nature \nof Sobol sampling because some sets of input parameters are very challenging, i.e., taking too \nmuch computational time, or even impossible to be successfully simulated. Therefore, a fixed \nnumber of microstructures was considered in each volume fraction bin to have a balanced \nexposure in the network training. \n14 \n \n \nFigure 4.4.

The Stress-\nVoltage form can be derived as the partial derivatives of the energy density function \nùëäùëä(ùúñùúñ, ùê∑ùê∑) =\n1\n2 ùúñùúñ: ‚ÑÇùê∑ùê∑=0: ùúñùúñ ‚àí ùê∑ùê∑. ùëûùëû: ùúñùúñ +\n1\n2 ùê∑ùê∑. ùúíùúíùúéùúé=0\n‚àí1 . ùê∑ùê∑:         ùúéùúé =\nùúïùúïùúïùúï\nùúïùúïùúïùúï , ùê∏ùê∏ =\nùúïùúïùúïùúï\nùúïùúïùê∑ùê∑. \n(4.3) \nSimilarly, by carrying out the partial Legendre transformation, we reach at the enthalpy density \nfunction \nùëäùëä‚àó(ùúñùúñ, ùê∑ùê∑) = ùëñùëñùëñùëñùëñùëñùê∏ùê∏[ùëäùëä(ùúñùúñ, ùê∑ùê∑) ‚àí ùê∑ùê∑. ùê∏ùê∏] = 1\n2 ùúñùúñ: ‚ÑÇùê∏ùê∏=0: ùúñùúñ ‚àí ùê∏ùê∏. ùëíùëí: ùúñùúñ + 1\n2 ùê∏ùê∏. ùúíùúíùúéùúé=0. ùê∏ùê∏ \n(4.4) \nwhere \n‚ÑÇùê∑ùê∑=0 = ‚ÑÇùê∏ùê∏=0 ‚àí ùëíùëíùëáùëá. ùúíùúíùúéùúé=0\n‚àí1 . ùëíùëí;        ùëûùëû = ùúíùúíùúéùúé=0\n‚àí1 . ùëíùëí. \n(4.5) \nAs a result, the Stress-Voltage form can be derived by identifying \nùúéùúé =\nùúïùúïùúïùúï‚àó\nùúïùúïùúïùúï ;        ùê∑ùê∑‚àó ‚âî ‚àíùê∑ùê∑ =\nùúïùúïùúïùúï‚àó\nùúïùúïùê∏ùê∏ . \n(4.6) \nFrom now on, ‚ÑÇ ‚âî ‚ÑÇùê∑ùê∑=0, ‚ÑÇ‚àó ‚âî ‚ÑÇùê∏ùê∏=0, ùúíùúí: = ùúíùúíùúéùúé=0. The problem of material \ncharacterization by homogenization can be described as finding appropriate fields‚Äô functions that \nminimize the total energy or enthalpy functional of an RVE or a cell such that they observe the \n17 \n \nperiodic boundary conditions, the mechanical compatibility equation, and Gauss‚Äôs law or \nFaraday‚Äôs law, and the averaging conditions.

Nevertheless, this is resulted from the saddle-\npoint variational problem, and it cannot be solved by standard CG solver easily. To this end, we \nused the Minimum Residual Method to solve the system for the enthalpy formulation. \n19 \n \nConsidering the symmetries in our derivation, the number of required operations to solve the \nFourier equations and find the homogenized properties is almost halved compared with \nconventional methods described in the literature. That is especially crucial in the real-world \napplicability of our data-driven design framework by having the most robust numerical \nhomogenizer for material characterization. Following the selection of microstructures in the \ndataset discussed in the previous section, we performed FFT homogenization simulations given \ntheir images (geometrical material phase information) to find their linear electromechanical \nproperties. For each microstructure, nine different far-field unit load cases were solved to find \nthe homogenized composite property matrices since the linear property matrix is nine by nine in \nthe most general case.

The Figure 4.6 results show a high level of \nvariation in the calculated properties as the range of variation with respect to the average values \nis between 0.02 and 6.38. To facilitate the ML training process, these label vectors were \nnormalized such that the average and the variance of each property component is zero and one, \nrespectively. \n20 \n \n \nFigure 4.6. The range of homogenized properties variation with respect to their average values in \nthe homogenized microstructures. \n1.5. \nTransVNet, a New Robust ML Model to Find SP Links \nThe cornerstone of our design methodology is our new machine-learning framework \ncalled TransVNet. At a high level, the goal of microstructure optimization is achieved by \ncreating two nonlinear maps: (a) the forward problem, which maps a given microstructure (e.g., a \ntwo-phase microstructure) to a specific set of properties, and (b) the inverse problem which, for a \ngiven target set of properties, produces a microstructure with the desired properties. However, \nboth the forward problem, which typically requires solving coupled nonlinear partial differential \nequations (PDEs), and the inverse problem, which involves solving a PDE-constrained nonlinear \noptimization problem, are computationally challenging. The current morphology optimization \napproaches are heavily reliant on multiple forward-model PDE calculations. Therefore, there is \nan urgent need for ML approaches that can efficiently and accurately solve both the forward and \ninverse problems in a single setting. Our proposed TransVNet network (illustrated in Figure 7) \naddresses this challenge. We aim to approximate the forward and inverse maps using deep \ngenerative models, a new type of neural network widely used in content generation, image \ntranslation, and style transfer, among other applications [65‚Äì67]. However, their application in \n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nmin/avg\nmax/avg\nstd/avg\n21 \n \nengineering design, materials design (especially heterogeneous microstructural design), and \nscientific computing has not been explored to the extent of their capabilities in literature.  \n \nFigure 4.7. Schematic diagram of our proposed ML method, TransVNet, for material design. \nOur proposed TransVNet, inspired by TransUNet [46], is suitable for 3D image and \nmixed-format data, which is the case for the current study as the best way to work with \nheterogeneous microstructures is to work with their images, not just limited expert-picked \nfeatures such as its auto-correlation statistics. We also did not choose to use TransUNet or \nsimilar 2D networks on the stack of 2D images as it cannot fully exploit the 3D relationships \nbetween different volumetric microstructural regions. Furthermore, our new TransVNet will be \nsemi-supervised in that its decoder will be used as a generative model for material design \n22 \n \nfollowing the training of the whole network consisting of its encoder and its decoder. To the best \nof authors‚Äô knowledge, this is the first generative model for the material design that leverages the \nstate-of-the-art ViTs in computer vision. Other notable differences are our customized CNN \nfeature extractor in the encoder instead of pre-trained CNNs (such as ResNet [68] as used in \nTransUNet [69]) since there is no pre-trained CNN for 3D images, its capability to include expert \nknowledge in the embeddings fed to the ViT which can improve the performance of the network \nand minimize the training costs, and considering a composite loss function since the network is a \nvariational autoencoder for the purpose of material design.

The cascaded upsampler consists of decoder \nblocks with a trilinear upsampler succeeded by two ReLU activated convolutional layers. \nFollowing some experiments, a single CUP led to poor performance on some test cases related to \nvastly different volume fraction ranges. Therefore, the final network has seven CUP heads \ndedicated to different volume fraction ranges to improve the general network performance.  \nThe generated dataset was split into two sets: training dataset consisting of 85% of \nsamples and testing or evaluation dataset. The training results in Figure 4.8 show that the loss \nvalues have decreased through back-propagation optimization via ADAM optimizer such that \nthey have reached an almost stationary state. The fluctuations are due to the cyclic multiplier of \nthe KL divergence loss as discussed above. This multiplier, taking values between zero and one, \nis displayed inside the figure as a function of the number of training epochs. In this training trial, \nthe number of epochs is 200, and each epoch takes 9 iterations to go over the whole training \ndataset. To assess the performance of the trained model, the unseen test dataset was used. The \nlabels, i.e., property vectors, were given to the decoder alongside a random sample of the \nisotropic normal distribution. The generated images were then fed into the trained encoder as the \nfast surrogate of the FFT homogenizer to estimate the properties of the designed microstructures \nand compare them with the values obtained from FFT homogenization in the test dataset. The \nregression plots for two important properties according to the application of the studied material \nsystem (flexible sensors) were drawn to assess the level of accuracy of the surrogate model, \nshown in Figure 4.9(a) for the C33 stiffness property and in Figure 4.9(b) for the e33 \npiezoelectric property, as well as the material designer, shown in Figure 4.9(a) for the C33 \nstiffness property and in Figure 4.9(b) for the e33 piezoelectric property. The ideal result \n26 \n \nassociated with maximum accuracy is when all data points are located on ùë¶ùë¶ = ùë•ùë• line. Therefore, \nit can be inferred from the plots and ùëÖùëÖ2 values that the models are generally accurate except \nwhere the underlying property manifold has not been explored equally in our generated dataset, \ni.e., the high-volume fraction regions. Despite this lower level of accuracy, the models are still \ncapable of finding the solutions qualitatively. \n \nFigure 4.8.

A patented support-\nfree ceramic AM technology, i.e., suspension-enclosing projection stereolithography [73] was \nutilized to fabricate piezoelectric ceramic-polymer composites.  \n28 \n \nThe feedstock material for printing consisted of a ceramic powder, a combination of \nphotocurable resins, and a dispersant. For exceptional dielectric properties, barium titanate \n(BaTiO3, < 2‚Äâ¬µm, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) was selected as the model ceramic \nmaterial at a concentration of 70 wt%. Two commercial resins were selected with desirable \nphotosensitivity at concentrations of 15 wt%. Formlabs resin (FLGPCL01, Formlabs, Boston, \nUSA) and 15 wt% Anycubic resin (white, ANYCUBIC, Shenzhen, China). To unify the particle \ndistribution, Solsperse 20000 (Lubrizol, United Kingdom, Europe) was chosen as the dispersant \nat 1 wt% of the final composition. Materials were manually mixed to visible uniformity and then \nran in a planetary ball mill for 2 hours at 300 RPM to ensure the slurry was truly homogeneous. \nFor final preparations, the slurry was degassed in vacuum at -1.5 bar for 30 minutes. \nIn short, the process enables the support-free fabrication of piezoceramic components \nwith complex overhanging structures by harnessing an elasto-viscoplastic ceramic suspension \nfeedstock and a meniscus-backflow-based layer-recoating method. A schematic of the printing \nprocess is shown in Figure 4.10, provided by Li et. al [73]. The suspension contains \nphotopolymer binder which is cured in a layerwise fashion by a UV projector on the \nstereolithography process. An image of a projected layer is provided in Figure 4.11(a) which \ncomes from a sliced layer of a CAD model. The projector not only cures the image in the \nsuspension in the x-y direction, but also penetrates in the z-direction to bond each layer together. \nFollowing the printing process, the UV-cured structure is cleaned of any excess suspension, as \nshown in Figure 4.11(b). Once printed, the green composite contains significant amounts of \nphotopolymer resin. Using a tube furnace (STF150, Carbolite-Gero LLC, Hope Valley, UK), the \nprinted part was fired at 600 ÷Øùê∂ùê∂ for 3 hours under Argon to decompose the resin. The residue char \nremained to bond the BTO particles. Following debinding, the parts were placed in a regular \n29 \n \nmuffle furnace (HTF18, Carbolite-Gero LLC, Hope Valley, UK) at 1330‚Äâ¬∞C for 240‚Äâmin. Once \nfinished sintering, the final part was a fully dense and organic ceramic. Sintered parts were taped \non one end to ensure polymer did not coat the testing surface. Following, they were placed in an \nFDM printed cubic vessel. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), an elastomer, was directed into the \nvessel using a syringe until the polymer reached the top surface of the ceramic, without \nbreaching the surface. The FDM vessel was placed in vacuum for 10 minutes to ensure the \npolymer had reached all cavities within the complex structure. The sample during the infiltration \nprocess and once removed from the vessel is shown in Figure 4.11(c). Excess polymer was cut \nfrom the ceramic presenting the final part tested (Figure 4.11(d)). \n \nFigure 4.10. The printing process schematic [73]. \n30 \n \n \nFigure 4.11. The process for polymer infiltrated ceramics include (a) printing, (b) green \nstructures, (c) polymer infiltration, and (d) the final part. \nIn this research, ùëëùëë33 was measured using a piezoelectric charge constant meter (PKD3-\n2000, PolyK Technologies LLC, Philipsburg, USA) at a force-frequency of 110 Hz. The \npiezoelectric voltage constant was calculated via the equation ùëîùëî33 = ùëëùëë33/…õùë£ùë£…õ0. Dielectric \nPermittivity was calculated via …õ33 = …õùë£ùë£…õ0, where ùúÄùúÄ0 = 8.854 √ó 10‚àí12 ùêπùêπ/ùëöùëö is the permittivity \nof air, and …õùë£ùë£ is the relative permittivity of the measured material [72]. The …õùë£ùë£ and tanùõøùõø were \nmeasured using an LCR meter (TG2811D, TONGHUI, Changzhou China) at 1 kHz frequency, \nsignal source output resistance of 100‚Ñ¶, a signal level of 1.0 V, and a parallel equivalent circuit. \nFor preparation, the samples were lightly coated on the top and bottom surface with Nickel \nconductive paint (MG Chemicals, Ontario Canada) to ensure maximum conductivity. The \n31 \n \nrelative permeability and loss tangent for all 4 samples were calculated. The experimental results \nare shown in Table 4.2. The FFT homogenization of the CAD model from which the \nexperimental samples were synthesized is as follows: (ùúÄùúÄùë£ùë£)33 =\nùõæùõæ33\nùúÄùúÄ0 = 250.14; ùëëùëë33 =\nùëíùëí33(ùê∂ùê∂‚àí1)33 = 122.3\nùëùùëùùê∂ùê∂\nùëÅùëÅ . Therefore, our homogenization method resulted in satisfactory \nestimation of the physical properties based on the average measurements. \nTable 4.2.

Our first method was HetMiGen to realize different geometrical \npossibilities for heterogeneous microstructures, especially the cellular or bincontinous ones with \nsuperior properties in flexible piezocomposites, without any need to experimental data. Its results \nindicate its versatility and computational efficiency using C++ parallel programming. We \nselected a balanced dataset from its results for optimum training. We developed our efficient \nFFT homogenizer to find the effective composite properties of the selected dataset. Its results \nshowed the vast design possibilities by the level of variation in each property component. The \ncornerstone of our methodology is our 3D and long-range inferring deep learner, called \n32 \n \nTransVNet, based on the state-of-the-arts in the computer vision field as well as our customized \narchitecture for its physics-aware applications, including our current static design problem. The \nnetwork is a variational autoencoder so that its trained encoder acts as the fast surrogate of costly \nnumerical properties homogenizer, such as the FFT one in this study, and its trained decoder \nperforms the generative design process given target properties, which is challenging due to the \nvery large number of design variables (643 in our trial) and the complexity of the multiphysics \nproperties manifold as each material phase contributes to a specific desired property in the \ncomposite. Nevertheless, our results show high accuracy of the surrogate model as well as \nsatisfactory performance of the material designer. This material designer is also advantageous \ncompared with other conventional methods since it can be constantly improved by providing \nmore data in the future through transfer learning and used almost instantaneously or online in \ncontrast with optimization-based methods. As seen in the regression plots for the case study, the \nproperty manifold has not been explored in balance, and the designer accuracy may be improved \nby generating more diverse set of high-volume fraction microstructures. The current study is \ncomputational yet purely data-driven resulting in the valuable byproduct of in-silico generated \ndataset of different material microstructures labeled with their multifunctional properties as well \nas the trained network, all expandable in future studies for other material systems and \napplications. Also, our computational framework has been built considering the future problems \nsuch as context-aware learning, e.g., the physical and manufacturing constraints as terms of the \nloss function, and dynamic or sequential property learning, e.g., the electrical properties as \nfunctions of frequency. Lastly, we presented the experimental details of the additive \nmanufacturing technique used to make the studied material system. Although the results point to \na strong link between our computational framework and the real-world application, future studies \n33 \n \nshould focus on decreasing the mismatch between these two and increasing the repeatability with \nlower variations of the composite properties among synthesized samples of a given \nmicrostructure geometry.  \nData Statement \nThe code and the dataset are made available on GitHub and can be found in \nhttps://github.com/ms-hashemi/HetMiGen. \nFunding \n This work was supported by Iowa State University. \n1.8. \nReferences \n[1] \nJ.E.
