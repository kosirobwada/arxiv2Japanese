This approach divides\nthe driving control of vehicles on highways into two parts: lane-\nchange decision and lane-change control, both of which are solved\nusing the MPC method. In the lane-change decision module, the\nminimum driving costs for each lane are computed and compared\nby solving the MPC problem to make lane-change decisions.\nIn the lane-change control module, a dynamic bicycle model is\nincorporated, and a multi-objective cost function is designed to\nobtain the optimal control inputs for the lane-change process. The\nproposed lane-change decision and control methods are simulated\nand validated within the SUMO platform under random highway\ntraffic conditions.\nIndex Terms—Autonomous Vehicle, Lane-change, Model Pre-\ndictive Control\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe quest for autonomous driving systems that seamlessly\nblend with the complex tapestry of human-driven traffic has\nbecome a focal point in the field of intelligent transportation.\nCentral to this pursuit is the development of advanced control\nstrategies that enable automated vehicles to execute critical\nmaneuvers with precision and safety.\nLane change, which necessitates the integration of both\nlongitudinal and lateral control, is considered one of the most\ncomplex driving maneuvers. Despite the inherent risks and\nthe fact that improper lane-changes are often implicated in\naccidents, it has been observed that lane-changes executed\nby autonomous vehicles can effectively increase the average\nspeed of the vehicle [1]. The decision-making process for\nlane-change is thus an indispensable aspect of autonomous\ndriving. It involves evaluating the feasibility of the lane-\nchange and ensuring that the maneuver is conducted with\nsafety and efficiency in mind [2]. Autonomous vehicles, by\nperceiving road conditions and the information of surrounding\nvehicles, can plan the optimal driving path. This not only\nsaves travel time for the vehicle itself but also contributes to\noptimizing traffic flow, enhancing road capacity, and reducing\nthe incidence of traffic accidents.\nThis work is supported by Guangzhou basic and applied basic research\nproject under Grant 2023A04J1688.\nIn recent years, MPC has emerged as a potent paradigm in\nthe orchestration of such maneuvers due to its forward-looking\ncapabilities and constraint-handling properties. By leveraging\na model of the vehicle’s dynamics and the surrounding en-\nvironment, MPC anticipates future states and derives optimal\ncontrol inputs that adhere to the constraints of the road and\nvehicle capabilities.\nThe execution of lane-change maneuvers by drivers involves\nnot only the consideration of their own vehicle but also the\nattention to nearby traffic participants. The MPC method has\nbeen proven to be an attractive approach in the domain of\nautonomous vehicle control [3], [4]. MPC uses a dynamic\nvehicle model to predict future states and determines an opti-\nmal control sequence for each moment, aiming to minimize a\npredefined performance index while satisfying constraints on\ncontrol and state variables [5]. Mukai and Kawabe developed a\nlane-change assistance system based on MPC that formulates\nthe problem of generating optimal lane-change paths as a\nmixed-integer programming problem, solving it with multi-\nparametric programming [6]. With existing infrastructure, lane\nmeasurement and control can be performed, thereby facil-\nitating lane-change decisions [7]. Utilizing this technology,\nKamal et al. designed an Economical Adaptive Cruise Control\n(EACC) lane-change model capable of real-time selection of\nthe optimal lane for fuel economy [8], [9]. Tejeddin proposed a\nMulti-Lane Adaptive Cruise Controller (MLACC), designed to\ndetermine the optimal speed and driving lane in real-time [10].\nCompared to Kamal’s model, the MLACC model accounts for\nroad grade and lane-change benefit thresholds. However, it\nonly updates vehicles ahead when generating traffic flow and\ndoes not consider the relationship between the ego vehicle\nand following vehicles. Karlsson outlines a control system\nfor self-driving cars to navigate highway exits, integrating\na new trajectory planner and decision manager to enhance\nsafety and comfort [11]. Bae introduces a real-time control\nframework for autonomous lane changes in heavy traffic\nusing cooperative behavior prediction and MPC enhanced by\nRecurrent Neural Networks in 2020 [12]. And in 2022 he\ndeveloped an online framework for smooth-path lane changes\nin dense traffic, integrating MPC with GANs for maneuver\ngeneration, and enhancing performance with adaptive safety\narXiv:2402.17524v1  [eess.SY]  27 Feb 2024\nmeasures and noise reduction, validated by simulations for\nefficiency and safety [13]. Ammour addresses autonomous\ndriving safety by presenting an MPC-based collision avoid-\nance algorithm accounting for dynamic traffic, with decision\nmaking and trajectory planning simplified for efficiency, and\nvalidated through simulations with mixed integer formulations\nand Sigmoid-based safety constraints [14]. Bhattacharyya and\nVahidi introduces aiMPC, an adaptive motion planning frame-\nwork for automated highway merging that optimizes vehicle\ninteractions through mixed integer quadratic programming and\ninverse optimal control, demonstrating effective merging in\nsimulations [15].\nA controlling method combining lane-change decision and\ncontrol, inspired by the previous work [10], is presented\nhere. We propose a method based on MPC that integrates\ndecision-making and vehicle control, capable of manipulating\nthe vehicle’s intended actions and specific controls in a phased\nmanner. This approach accounts not only for the motion\ncontrol of the vehicle itself but also incorporates interactions\nwith surrounding traffic into its calculations. Furthermore,\nthis method conveniently facilitates subsequent improvements\nto individual modules. Through this holistic control strategy,\nan autonomous vehicle can dynamically adapt to the rapidly\nchanging conditions of the road environment, ensuring both\nthe safety and efficiency of lane-change maneuvers.\nThe paper is organized in the following manner. Section II\ndescribes the lane-change decision method based on MPC.\nSection III details the establishment of a dynamic bicycle\nmodel and the control of the vehicle based on MPC. Section\nIV presents the simulation results and analysis.\nII. LANE-CHANGE DECISION\nWhen the ego vehicle maintains a straight course on the road\nand the distance to the lead vehicle in the current lane is less\nthan ∆sref, a lane-change can be considered. By comparing\nthe driving cost of the current lane with that of the adjacent\nlanes, the optimal lane for travel is determined, and a decision\nis made to either change lane or stay in the current lane.\nA.

In this model, we consider the ego vehicle\nand the preceding and following vehicles on the current lane as\npoint masses. For the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) problem,\ntake the distance ∆s between the ego vehicle and the leader,\nthe distance ∆sf between the ego vehicle and the follower, the\nspeed v of the ego vehicle, the speed vl of the leading vehicle,\nthe speed vf of the following vehicle, the acceleration a of the\nego vehicle, and the jerk j of the ego vehicle as state variables,\nand take the acceleration a of the ego vehicle as the control\nvariable. The state space variables and control variables are\nshown as formula (1)(2).\nTo represent the kinematic equations of a vehicle in state-\nspace form, formula (3) can be obtained.

This ap-\nproach allows one to balance and prioritize the various aspects\nof the vehicle’s performance that are important for the driving\ntask. The cost function used for lane-change decisions in this\npaper is presented in formula (6a), and the description of each\nvariable in cost function can be referred to in TABLE I.\nThe initial term of the cost function pertains to the velocity\ncomponent. Within the scope of this study’s scenario, which\nnecessitates the vehicle’s continuous gap-seeking and over-\ntaking maneuvers, the maintenance of a comparatively high\ntraveling speed is of paramount importance. The reference\nspeed vref is slightly higher than the speeds of surrounding\nvehicles.\nm1 represents the jerk of the ego vehicle. However, comfort\nis not considered the most critical criterion; hence, the weight\nassigned to this term is relatively low.\nTABLE I\nPARAMETERS OF COST FUNCTION IN LANE-CHANGE DECISION\nParameters\nDescription\nValue\nvref\nA desired speed higher than that of the surrounding vehicles\n27 m/s\nth\nTime headway during car-following\n1.5 s\nd0\nThe reference following distance when the ego vehicle is stationary\n5 m\nλ1\nJerk weight term\n0.2\nλ2\nLeading vehicle distance weight term\n1\nλ3\nFollowing vehicle distance weight term\n0.2\nlsw\nLane-change decision. 0 refers to stay, 1 refers to switch\n0 or 1\nud\nDesired control effort\nJth\nLane-change threshold of driving cost\n0.3\nkp\nPenalty term on lane-change\n0.1\nt\nCurrent time step\nl\nPredictive time step\nm2 represents cost related to the leading vehicle. When ego\nvehicle is too close to the leader, the driving cost begins to rise.\nHowever, when ∆s is far enough, meaning the actual distance\nis further than the desired distance ∆sd, it can be assumed that\nthe leading vehicle does not interfere with the movement of\nego vehicle, allowing the vehicle to accelerate freely within its\nlane. Therefore, the driving cost at this moment is considered\nto be 0.\nWhen ego vehicle stays in its current lane, the following\nvehicle should be ignored. Consequently, within the com-\nputation of the driving cost for ego vehicle in its lane, the\nfollowing distance term, denoted as m3, is assigned a value\nof 0. In contrast, when assessing the driving cost for potential\nmaneuvers into adjacent lanes, the influence of the following\nvehicle is similar to the m2 scenario.\nC. Constraints\nUndoubtedly, both lane-change and car-following behaviors\nnecessitate conditions where collision avoidance is paramount.\nTherefore, imposing a minimum longitudinal distance con-\nstraint between vehicles is necessary. To define the boundaries\nof following distance and avoid collision, hard constraints are\nadded:\n\u001a ∆s(l | t) > dsafe = 2b\n(7a)\n∆sf(l | t) > dsafe = 2b\n(7b)\nwhere b = 5m represents the body length of the ego vehicle.\nAdditionally, considering the actual acceleration and decel-\neration performance of the vehicles, it’s necessary to impose\nhard constraints on the vehicle’s acceleration.\na ∈ [amin, amax]\n(8)\nwhere amin = −4.5 m/s2, amax = 2.6 m/s2.\nD. Future State Prediction\nOn highways, sudden stops or spurts in speed by lead-\ning vehicles are uncommon, with surrounding vehicles pre-\ndominantly maintaining a steady pace. Consequently, it is\na reasonable assumption that vl will remain constant over\nthe predictive horizon. Therefore, this paper posits that the\ncontroller measures the leading vehicle’s velocity vl at the\npresent time step k and continuously applies this value in\nsubsequent calculations within the predictive horizon, with\na prediction horizon of N = 50 selected. This approach to\nresolving the MPC issue is known as the ”Frozen Time”\nimplementation.\nE. Optimal Lane Selection\nAt each moment k, the ego vehicle retrieves information\nof surrounding vehicles, including the relative distance ∆sl,i\nand velocity vl,i of the leading and following vehicles in the\ncurrent lane and adjacent lanes, where i ∈ {r, c, l} denotes the\nlane. Subsequently, it first determines whether the left and right\nlanes exist and whether there are conditions for lane-change.\nFor all available lanes, the model optimizes the minimum\nfuture driving cost and the corresponding control inputs using\na MPC approach. It then determines the optimal lane at the\ncurrent moment and executes the decision to either remain in\nthe current lane or change lanes, as detailed in Algorithm 1.\nRegarding the safety conditions during lane-change, consid-\nering that the speeds of vehicles in the traffic flow other than\nthe ego vehicle are generally stable, a constant value is used\nas the safety distance criterion, set as dsafe = 3b = 15m.\nThus, as long as the longitudinal distances with the leading\nand following vehicles in the adjacent lanes are both greater\nthan dsafe, it is considered to meet the safety conditions for\nlane change.\nIII. LANE-CHANGE CONTROL\nThe previous chapter elaborates the methodology for discre-\ntionary lane-change decisions at each time step. This chapter\nwill introduce the control mechanisms engaged to maneuver\nthe vehicle during the lane-change process subsequent to the\ndecision, also using the MPC method.\nAt each discrete time step, the control of the vehicle can\nbe construed as a composite function of acceleration a and\nthe steering angle δ of the front wheels. The objective of\nthe proposed controller is to ascertain the optimal control\ncombination and apply it to the ego vehicle.\nA. Dynamic Bicycle Model\nIn a highway scenario, using the dynamic bicycle model can\nmake the calculation of its driving trajectory more accurate.\nAlgorithm 1: Determination of lsw and ud\nInput: li, ∆si, ∆sf,i, v, vl,i, vf,i, a, j\nOutput: lsw, ud\n1 while MLACC engaged do\n2\n(Jc, ud,c) ←\nNMPC(lc, ∆sc, ∆sf,c, v, vl,c, vf,c, a, j)\n3\nif Jc ≤ Jth then\n4\nreturn lsw ← 0, ud ← ud,c\n5\nelse\n6\n(Jr, ud,r) ←\nNMPC(lr, ∆sr, ∆sf,r, v, vl,r, vf,r, a, j)\n7\n(Jl, ud,l) ←\nNMPC(ll, ∆sl, ∆sf,l, v, vl,l, vf,l, a, j)\n8\nif (1 + kp)Jr < Jc and Jr ≤ Jl then\n9\nreturn lsw ← −1, ud ← ud,r\n10\nelse if (1 + kp)Jl < Jc and Jl < Jr then\n11\nreturn lsw ← 1, ud ← ud,l\n12\nelse\n13\nreturn lsw ← 0, ud ← ud,c\n14\nend\n15\nend\n16 end\nThe vehicle dynamics model used in this article is described\nas formula (9)(10)(11).

Cost Function\nWhen the vehicle is driving in its lane without making a\nlane-change decision, the lateral control objective of the ego\nvehicle is to maintain the center of the lane, and the longitu-\ndinal control objective is to follow the preceding vehicle.\nWhen the vehicle makes a lane-change decision, the ref-\nerence lateral position yref is updated to correspond to the\ncenterline coordinates of the targeted adjacent lane. The lateral\ncontrol aim for the ego vehicle is to converge toward yref,\nwhile the longitudinal control objective shifts to maintaining\na safe following distance behind the leading vehicle in the\ntarget lane.\nSimilar to the cost function in lane-change decision, the\nego vehicle needs to maintain a high reference speed vref,\nto ensure it can overtake other vehicles while driving. An-\nother important factor is the lateral deviation of the vehicle’s\ncenter of mass from the centerline of the lane. The designed\ncontroller should minimize this deviation to keep the vehicle\ndriving straight. Additionally, for a smooth driving experience,\nit’s necessary to control the acceleration a, steering angle\nδ, rate of change in acceleration ∆a, and rate of change in\nsteering angle ∆δ.\nJ =\nt+T\nX\nl=t\nλv ∥v(l | t) − vref∥2 +\nt+T\nX\nl=t\nλy ∥y(l | t) − yref∥2\n+\nt+T\nX\nl=t\nλl max (0, dl (l | t) − dsafe)\n+\nt+T\nX\nl=t\nλδ∥δ(l | t)∥2 +\nt+T −1\nX\nl=t+1\nλ∆δ∥δ(l | t) − δ(l − 1 | t)∥2\n+\nt+T\nX\nl=t\nλa∥a(l | t)∥2 +\nt+T −1\nX\nl=t+1\nλ∆a∥a(l | t) − a(l − 1 | t)∥2\ns.t.\ndl (l | t) = dl (l − 1 | t) + [v (l − 1 | t) − vl] Ts\n(16)\nTABLE III\nWEIGHT PARAMETERS OF COST FUNCTION\nParameters\nValue\nParameters\nValue\nλv\n1\nλδ\n100000\nλy\n100\nλ∆δ\n10000\nλl\n-100\nλa\n1\nλ∆a\n50\nTo maintain a safe distance dsafe from the leading vehicle\nwhile also maximizing the use of gaps in traffic for overtaking,\nit is advisable to employ either a cost or constraint to limit\nthis term. Utilizing a constraint may render the MPC problem\ninfeasible when another vehicle suddenly cuts in front or when\ncontrol deviation causes the distance to the leading vehicle to\nfall below dsafe. Therefore, this study employs a cost function\nto regulate the following distance. When the distance to the\nleading vehicle exceed dsafe, the cost remains at 0. If the\ndistance falls below dsafe, the cost rises sharply in a linear\nfashion. This approach not only sustain the distance from the\nleading vehicle above dsafe as much as possible, but also\nguarantee that the problem remains solvable even when the\ndistance contract to less than dsafe.\nC. Constraints\n• The velocity of the ego vehicle should comply with the\nspeed limit regulations of the highway.\n• The ego vehicle is situated on a three-lane road, and\nconstraints should be applied to the road boundaries.\n• The aforementioned dynamic bicycle model holds true\nonly when the steering angle of the front wheels is small;\nhence, it is necessary to impose constraints on the values\nof the front wheel steering angle.\n• Considering the vehicle’s actual acceleration and braking\ncapabilities, constraints on acceleration must be applied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nv(l | t) ∈ [vmin, vmax]\n(17a)\ny(l | t) ∈ [ymin, ymax]\n(17b)\nδ(l | t) ∈ [δmin, δmax]\n(17c)\na(l | t) ∈ [amin, amax]\n(17d)\nwhere\nvmin = 20 m/s, vmax = 30 m/s;\nymin = −9.6 m, ymax = 0 m;\nδmin = −5◦, δmax = 5◦;\namin = −4.5 m/s2, amax = 2.6 m/s2.\nIV. SIMULATION\nA. Platform & Rules\nThis article uses SUMO as the simulation platform. The\nroad vehicle distribution is randomly generated, placing all\nvehicles at time zero, and then the simulation begins. For\nsurrounding vehicles, the Intelligent Driver Model(IDM) car-\nfollowing model and LC2013 lane-change model in SUMO\nare used, canceling the tendency to drive to the right, and\novertaking is allowed in all three lanes.\nB.

As it closes in on the leading vehicle, reducing\nthe gap to less than ∆sref, the ego vehicle decides to execute\na lane change to the right. During the maneuver, the vehicle\nslightly increases its speed to align more swiftly with the\ncenter of the adjacent lane and then returns to the reference\nspeed vref once it stabilizes in the new lane. If the overtaking\nspace is not sufficiently clear, or the relative positioning of the\nvehicles does not meet the safe criteria for lane-change, the\nego vehicle opts to decelerate and follow the leading vehicle,\nadjusting its relative position with surrounding traffic. It waits\nand seeks an ideal gap within the traffic flow to safely complete\nthe lane-change.\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nt(s)\n-8\n-6\n-4\n-2\n0\ny(m)\nleft lane\nmiddle lane\nright lane\nFig. 4.
