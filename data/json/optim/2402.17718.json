E-mail address: weichen@northwestern.edu  Abstract  Laser directed-energy deposition (DED) offers notable advantages in additive manufacturing (AM) for producing intricate  geometries and facilitating material functional grading. However, inherent challenges such as material property inconsistencies  and part variability persist, predominantly due to its layer-wise fabrication approach. Critical to these challenges is heat  accumulation during DED, influencing the resultant material microstructure and properties. Although closed-loop control methods  for managing heat accumulation and temperature regulation are prevalent in DED literature, few approaches integrate real-time  monitoring, physics-based modeling, and control simultaneously in a cohesive framework. To address this, we present a digital  twin (DT) framework for real-time model predictive control of process parameters of the DED for achieving a specific process  design objective. To enable its implementation, we detail the development of a surrogate model utilizing Long Short-Term Memory  (LSTM)-based machine learning which uses Bayesian Inference to predict temperatures across various spatial locations of the  DED-built part.  This model offers real-time predictions of future temperature states. In addition, we introduce a Bayesian  Optimization (BO) method for Time Series Process Optimization (BOTSPO). Its foundational principles align with traditional BO,  and its novelty lies in our unique time series process profile generator with a reduced dimensional representation. BOTSPO is used  for dynamic process optimization in which we deploy BOTSPO to determine the optimal laser power profile, aiming to achieve  desired mechanical properties in a DED build. The identified profile establishes a process trajectory that online process  optimizations aim to match or exceed in performance. This paper elucidates components of the digital twin framework, advocating  its prospective consolidation into a comprehensive digital twin system for AM.    © 2023 The Authors.

Introduction  Laser directed-energy deposition (DED) is an additive  manufacturing (AM) technique where powder or wire  feedstock is introduced into a laser-formed moving melt pool,  creating a deposition bead. Stacking these beads produces a  three-dimensional part. Laser DED allows for near-net shape  fabrication of freeform geometries with internal features and  offers material grading unattainable by conventional methods,  facilitating localized material optimization [1]. However, broad  application of DED is currently limited by heterogeneity and  anisotropy in DED part mechanical properties, as well as part- to-part variation, due to the incremental nature of DED  fabrication [2].  DED's layer-wise fabrication, paired with high melt  temperatures, induces cyclic thermal cycles, leading to unique  microstructural textures  [3]. The cumulative heat and additive  nature create uneven thermal histories. Although post-build  treatments can moderate this, some DED phenomena, like δ- phase growth in Inconel 718, optimize subsequent treatments  2  Author name / Manufacturing Letters 00 (2023) 000–000  [4]. Thermal accumulation can result in chemical alterations  due to selective evaporation of elements, while heterogeneous  cooling conditions can result in spatially variate mechanical  properties [5,6]. While hybrid additive manufacturing that  introduces secondary energy sources can adjust microstructure,  they increase costs and complexity [7]. Control of DED  properties via control of laser power therefore remains a  worthwhile technique. Thermal objectives may be derived  from experimentally observed insights, or solidification  simulations using phase-field, cellular automata, or kinetic  Monte Carlo techniques [8].  Several works in DED sought to minimize part variations,  using direct melt pool temperature measurements as an input  for a PID controller. For instance, a rule-based controller was  used to stabilize melt pool temperatures, reducing part-to-part  porosity variation [9]. Such control schemes fail to take  advantage of disturbances known a priori, while feedforward  control can proactively anticipate and compensate for such  disturbances. For instance, Liao et al. employed a virtual PID  in a heat transfer simulation to generate a feedforward control  input  [10].  Integrating  these  with  feedback  control  compensates for discrepancies in the model versus real-world  conditions. A hybrid feedback-feedforward system, merging a  heat transfer model with a PI controller, effectively maintained  melt pool temperatures by adjusting laser power [11].  However, such models may not intelligently track changes in  system dynamics if such dynamics were not modelled  explicitly. Incorporating additional physics to these closed- loop controllers typically increases the cycle time, reducing  controller performance.  Evidently, there is need for a manufacturing system model  for DED that 1) models a target parameter, such as temperature  or flaw concentration in the relevant regions that cannot be  directly observed, 2) is updated during the online process to  account for differences between the physical system and the  virtual model, and 3) communicates changes in the system state  to the real system, aiding control decisions based on these  updated conditions. Such a system is termed a digital twin (DT)  [12,13]. Though many works have built so-called “digital  twins” for DED that track model dynamics as a response to in- situ measurement data, these predictions are often not suited for  online control due to the computational complexity and the lack  of the characteristic bidirectional communication between the  digital and physical twins.  As a result, these are more suited to  be termed as “digital shadows” only.  To build this digital twin for part temperature in DED, we  must first construct a fast surrogate model for online  evaluation. Various methods have been used for rapid, reduced- order temperature models in AM. Physics-informed neural  networks [14] were used to assess transient temperatures near  a DED-like heat source [15]. However, modifications in  boundary conditions, such as geometry changes, require  extremely expensive retraining. GRU neural networks [16] and  later, recurrent graph networks [17], were used for temperature  prediction in DED parts. While they perform well for new  geometries and longer time steps, their effectiveness under  dynamic laser power variation remains untested. The heat  conduction graph network [18] accommodates variable laser  power, but its predictions lack the uncertainty quantification  (UQ) and real-time prediction which is vital for the digital twin  framework. UQ offers insights into model accuracy, a required  feature for intelligent decision-making in the online system.  Moving forward the offline trained surrogate model should  be employed for online predictive control. In most cases, online  predictive models need a process trajectory, which is obtained  by offline optimization. As accurate DED simulations can  involve detailed physics, they are typically expensive to  execute. It is therefore beneficial to minimize the number of  iterations in the optimization process [19]. Attempts at finding  an optimized laser power profile of DED have been made;  however, many require a fully differentiable surrogate model  [20]. Differentiable simulations make the derivatives of  objective functions with respect to process inputs directly  available; however, they have very high memory requirements,  which limits their applicability to part scale builds.   Recognizing these challenges, the integration of digital twin  technology within the laser DED process aligns with Industry  4.0's drive towards intelligent manufacturing [21]. Digital  twins, key elements of Industry 4.0, facilitate a dynamic  manufacturing environment, enhancing real-time control and  predictive accuracy through seamless integration of cyber- physical systems [22]. This approach not only embodies the  principles of Industry 4.0 but also marks a significant  advancement in adaptive, data-driven manufacturing process  control and optimization.  In this study, we present a digital twin architecture to control  and optimize manufacturing processes, with the following  contributions:  1. We propose a digital twin framework for the additive  manufacturing process that facilitates a bidirectional  information exchange between virtual and physical systems  where the framework incorporates online model predictive  control for real-time process adjustments and offline model  updates for enhanced prediction accuracy. Additionally, the  framework mitigates sources of uncertainties including the  “unknown of unknowns”.   2. We develop a Bayesian LSTM architecture as a surrogate  model which predicts the future temperature state by  looking at the past measurable temperature state, and other  input variables It handles the spatial-temporal dynamics of  the DED process and emphasizes significant past events  while quantifying uncertainty—vital for informed decision- making within a digital twin framework. Different from  conventional LSTMs, our model adopts Bayesian inference,  utilizing Monte Carlo dropout methods to gauge predictive  uncertainty by estimating Bayesian posterior distributions.  3. We develop a low-dimensional representation for high  dimensional time series of process inputs by decomposing  high-dimensional laser profile time series into a set of low- dimensional parametric time series functions that capture  distinct laser profile characteristics. This enables the use of  BO to find an optimal time series profile with adaptive  sampling using fewer samples. We demonstrate the  capabilities of this method by optimizing a time series  profile of laser power with the objective of maximizing heat  treatment time throughout DED-built parts for better  material quality.  This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 delineates the  architecture of a digital twin framework applied to additive  manufacturing. Section 3 discusses the implementation and  validation of a Bayesian LSTM designed to forecast    Author name / Manufacturing Letters 00 (2023) 000–000   3  temperatures during laser DED. Section 4 explicates the novel  Bayesian Optimization for Time Series Process Optimization  (BOTSPO) method, which reduces the complexity of time- series data for laser power inputs in DED processes and  examines its efficacy in deriving an optimal power profile. The  paper concludes with a synopsis of its contributions and a  discourse on prospective research directions.  2. Digital Twin (DT) framework for the Additive  Manufacturing Process  Many existing DTs only provide a “digital shadow” of the  physical system. In this work, a DT framework is proposed to  integrate physics-based models together with real-time data  collection (physics-based ML) for fast and accurate -property  prediction and process optimization. Different from existing  works that use system performance as objective function in  optimization or decision making, we introduce two-way  (physical-to-virtual and virtual-to-physical) information- centric value proposition.  Model Predictive Control (MPC) is  included for anticipating and taking control actions based on  current and future events, which distinguish it from linear– quadratic regulators and PID controllers. Unlike standard  practices where model validation is a one-time, offline event,  our DT leverages continuous online data to ensure the model  remains accurate and reliable, effectively bridging the gap  between the physical and digital realms. This method advances  how we implement model predictive control, offering a more  adaptive and responsive system compared to conventional  control strategies.  To demonstrate the above-described DT framework, we  present a DT to support real-time DED manufacturing process  optimization, which is shown in Fig. 1. The left block is the  physical system, and the right block is the digital system. The  two blocks in between show the bidirectional interplay between  the physical system and the digital system. The physical system  is the manufacturing process which is guided and programed  by pre-process inputs and monitored by sensors. The process  parameters are controlled, e.g., laser power. To achieve the  objective of temperature control, the digital system is created  using high fidelity finite element method (FEM) simulations  which take geometric parameters, material parameters and  process parameters as inputs, and predict temperature at each  location of the built part. In this study, the process control  parameters are the laser power at each step in time. To enable  real time analysis and decision making, a surrogate time series  model is needed to replace the expensive FEM simulations.     Uncertainties exist in the DT including aleatoric uncertainty  arising from inherent randomness and unavoidable variations  (e.g., material and manufacturing variability, and sensor noise)  and epistemic uncertainty arising from limited knowledge and  data (e.g., numerical uncertainty, and model uncertainty). To  account for both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, the  predictive model is updated by combining data from both the  physical and the digital system. The offline updated surrogate  model is then fed into an online MPC system. Different from  traditional feedback control techniques, MPC can better handle  constraints and nonlinearities associated with the object or  system of interest and performs process optimization to identify  the best control action based on the current state of the system,  a predictive model, and a decision-making objective. MPC  optimizes the current timeslot while considering future  timeslots through iterative optimization of a finite time- horizon, implemented sequentially. With real-time sensing, the  capability of MPC allows the digital twin to make real-time  (online) adjustments and optimizations in response to  uncertainty and variations that cannot be predicted or mitigated  offline, the so-called unknown of unknowns (i.e., unexpected  or unforeseeable conditions).  In this work, we focus on the development of the surrogate  model and offline process optimization in the digital system,  which are described in the following sections.  3. The Bayesian LSTM network as a surrogate model   3.1 Architecture of the Bayesian LSTM model  To be effective for real-time operation, and tightly coupled  operation with a physical system that it mirrors, the digital twin  must be capable of rapid data processing and control [12]. As  Fig. 1.

We achieve  this speedup using a recurrent neural network-based surrogate  model, which also considers past events while making  predictions. In this section, we describe the architecture of the  model and the design decisions behind it.  The surrogate model as shown in Fig. 2 predicts the  temperature history at a particular point by taking the following  features, as illustrated by Fig. 4: the distance from the point to  the laser deposition point (𝐷𝐿! ) and to the nearest surface  boundary (𝐷𝑁! ), the time at which the point is deposited  (𝑇\"#$!%), the laser power at the deposition time (𝐿𝑃\"#$!%), the  current laser power (𝐿𝑃!), and the measured temperature from  the previous time window (𝑇!&':!&)). We identify these inputs  from previous successful RNN-based modeling of the DED  process [16], with the addition of the time and spatially variant  laser power features. The current temperature prediction at a  location can be written as a function of Bayesian LSTM model  as follows:     𝑇! = 𝑓(𝐷𝐿!, 𝐷𝑁!, 𝑇\"#$!%, 𝐿𝑃\"#$!%, 𝐿𝑃!, 𝑇!&) )  (1)    These input features are either time-variant or time- invariant. We found through experimentation that the Bayesian  LSTM performed poorly when provided with time-invariant  data as opposed to the time-variant data. This performance  degradation occurs even if only a portion of the input data is  time-invariant. Therefore, our surrogate model is composed of  two primary data paths, one for time-variant data and the other  for time-invariant data, which are eventually concatenated. The  time-invariant data is fed to a forward layer with 100 nodes  whose output corresponds to spatial information, such as  location.  In this model, we have two LSTM layers with 500 LSTM  neuron units. This neuron count strikes a balance between  computational efficiency and model complexity. LSTMs are  preferred in our study for their architecture, which includes a  memory cell and three gates. This enables the model to  effectively regulate the flow of information, remembering  … … LSTM Layer 1 LSTM Layer 2 !

The temporal output  is the temperature of the current time step of the selected node.  Fig. 3.

The selection of these hyperparameters followed a tuning  process to ensure the model's performance is maximized for our  specific dataset and task requirements. Their ability to handle  complex dependencies makes them similar to GRUs for  modeling the intricate thermal patterns in DED applications  [25,26]. Their capability to utilize past data for future forecasts  aligns with our need to monitor the evolving state of the DED- built part [27]. Our enhanced Bayesian LSTM model integrates  an attention layer [28]. Specifically, the attention mechanism  in our Bayesian LSTM model operates by assigning varying  weights to different time steps in the temperature data  sequence, thereby allowing the network to 'attend' more to  moments with significant thermal activity and less to others  [29,30]. This facilitates the model's ability to dynamically  emphasize temperature anomalies or shifts that could lead to  defects, enabling precise adjustments to process inputs.   To enhance the model's accuracy in representing the spatial  variations in DED, we incorporated a feedforward layer with  100 nodes [31].  This feedforward layer aggregates the features  extracted by the LSTM layers, combining the sequential  temporal data processed by the LSTM with spatial correlations  [29] Recognizing the importance of model robustness, we  introduced post-LSTM dropout layers. Dropout techniques  [32], serve as effective regularization tools that prevent  overfitting. Our model employs Monte Carlo dropout to  quantify uncertainty alongside mitigating overfitting by  sampling with random node exclusion. Specifically, Monte  Carlo dropout is applied during both the training and prediction  phases to all the layers of the neural network, repeatedly  'turning off' a random subset of neurons in the network [33].  This process creates multiple 'thinned' networks, each  generating its own predictions [34]. The variance among these  samples indicates uncertainty. Through this architecture, our  model can predict future temperature while simultaneously  quantifying uncertainty.  3.2 Bayesian LSTM model training strategy  To train our Bayesian LSTM machine learning model, we  used FEM simulations to generate a bank of simulated full-field  temperature measurements for our test geometry. To that end,  we used a GPU-accelerated explicit heat transfer model  to  simulate our test geometry’s temperature history across a range  of deposition laser power profiles. Then, we sampled  temperature histories from individual locations across the  build, and used the temperatures experienced by these  individual points to train the data-driven model. This approach  is illustrated by Fig. 3.  Fig. 4. illustrates the test geometry used in this work, which  consists of a bidirectionally scanned thin wall constructed from  Inconel 718 built on a substrate of low-carbon 1018 steel. The  scanning speed was set to 7 mm/s, and the 1/e2 beam diameter  was set to 2.24 mm. The build consists of 40 consecutive 0.75  mm tall layers. The simulation parameters are calibrated to an  in-house laser-powder DED machine, the Additive Rapid  Prototyping Instrument (ARPI). A detailed discussion of the  formulation of the thermal model and comparison of full-field  temperature predictions with the physical DED system be  found in Liao et al. [10]. The model was also proven to offer  sufficiently accurate melt pool temperature predictions for laser  power optimization in [11].  A two-step method, combining Latin Hypercube sampling  (LHS) and Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) was used to  generate a representative library of laser power profiles;  namely, LHS is used to sample from a space of parameters that  describe the laser history. LHS is used for its ability to  efficiently sample from the entire high-dimensional space of  experimental parameters [35]. To accurately sample the space  of possible laser profiles, the laser power profile was broken  into three fundamental properties: frequency, mean, and  variance. The frequency component captures how rapidly the  laser power is allowed to change from one time step to the next.  High-frequency changes are reflective of events such as rapid  drops in laser power, as may be experienced in an optimized  trajectory near a turnaround point [11]. The mean component  alters the average of the laser power in the trajectory. Finally,  the variance component gauges the extent of variability or  fluctuation within the laser power trajectory. These three  variables provide a comprehensive coverage of the parameter  space [36].  Using LHS, 50 parameter sets were generated within set  bounds (Mean: 400-700 W, Variance: 50-300 W, Frequency:  0-1 Hz) heuristically based on prior IN718 deposition  Fig. 5. Schematic of sliding window which is applied to feed data while  training the Bayesian LSTM Model. The sliding window has a length of  200-time steps, which is 2 seconds. The frequency is 50 Hz, and the sliding  window slides for 100 time steps.  Fig. 4. Snapshot of FEA simulation, illustrating extracted features. The laser,  indicated by 𝐿𝑃$, travels in the direction of the red arrow. The point of interest  is represented by the pink star, which is at a distance 𝐷𝑁$ from the closest free  surface and 𝐷𝐿$ from the laser. The laser power is recorded for the current  time, as well as the time at which the first element containing the node was  activated. When an element in the current layer is within the laser spot  boundary, (A in the Fig.), it is activated. The final wall height is 30 mm. The  location of the three nodes under consideration are included.  6  Author name / Manufacturing Letters 00 (2023) 000–000  experience. The profiles were then generated via MCMC in  arbitrary unit space and scaled and shifted to the requested  mean and variance. The signals were then filtered to the  required temporal frequency with a 2nd-order low-pass  Butterworth filter. The Butterworth filter is a general-use filter  in signal processing with a flat frequency response in the  passband [37].  From each run of the FEM simulation, we collect various  data which will form the input features to our surrogate model.  Throughout the paper, we refer to “locations” of importance in  the DED-built part; these locations are one-to-one mappings  with nodes in the finite element model. At each time step, we  record the input and output data required to train our machine  learning model. The finite element simulation runs at an  explicit time step of 0.002 seconds. The full-field temperature  field and training parameters are continuously gathered every  10 simulation steps, or every 0.02 seconds. We then repeat the  simulation using different laser profiles, resulting in training  datasets for each laser profile.  To achieve location-agnosticism of the surrogate model, we  must sample from datasets of multiple laser profiles from all  the available 96000 nodes during training. For this purpose, we  have developed a data management pipeline. Each sample used  for training is a sliding window of time-series data [38] as  shown in Fig. 5. During sampling, time windows are  overlapped such that the latter half of data points in one  window are also included as the former half of data points in  the next window [39]. During training, individual time  windows are sampled randomly from datasets of 80 laser power  profiles of 280 seconds to create mini batches of samples.  Using these mini-batches, training of the model proceeds  using the gradient descent method. Loss is calculated using the  evidence lower bound (ELBO) [40] method and is defined as  follows:    𝐿(𝜙, 𝜃, 𝑥) ≔ 𝔼*~,!(⋅|𝑥)[ln 𝑝0(𝑥|𝑧)] − 𝐷12;𝑞3(⋅ |𝑥) ∥ 𝑝> (2)    where 𝑥  is the observed data points, 𝜙  are the parameters  defining the approximate posterior distribution, 𝜃  is the  Parameters of the true intractable distribution,  𝑧 is a latent  (unknown) continuous random variable, 𝑝0 (𝑥|𝑧)is the true,  intractable distribution of 𝑥, 𝑞3 (⋅ |𝑥)  is the approximate  posterior, and 𝐷12  is the Kullbach-Leibler (KL) divergence  from distribution 𝑝0 (⋅ |𝑥) to distribution 𝑞3 (⋅ |𝑥). The ELBO  loss function is originally described in Auto-Encoding  Variational Bayes [40], and we found via experimentation that  it is highly effective when used for training our surrogate  model. The ELBO method stands out for uncertainty  quantification due to its decomposition of the marginal  likelihood into two interpretable components: the expected log- likelihood and the KL divergence. The first term, expected log- likelihood, quantifies how well the model explains the  observed data, whereas the KL divergence penalizes deviations  from the prior and acts as a regularize, preventing overfitting.  This decomposition provides a robust balance between data  fidelity and model complexity, ensuring a principled  quantification of uncertainties. In the next section, we will look  at the prediction capability of the Bayesian LSTM model.   3.3 Evaluation of the LSTM Model  In evaluating the performance of our Bayesian LSTM  model, we compare the resulting outputs against simulated  measurements. In our first evaluation we input the past  measurable temperature or the actual temperature as an input.  The LSTM model's performance assessment is carried out  using a set of 20 distinct laser power profiles, each with a  duration of 280 seconds, specifically reserved for validation  purposes.  In this case the models achieved an 𝑅4 score of 0.75,  indicative of a good degree of accuracy and alignment with the  expected outcomes. The 𝑅4 score, commonly referred to as the  coefficient of determination, quantitatively measures the  proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is  predictably explained by the independent variables in a  regression model. This result was validated through k-fold  cross-validation and independent set evaluation to ensure  model robustness against overfitting.  The temperature profiles for nodes 27550, 37550, and 32550  are shown over an extended period for a representative laser  power profile in Fig. 6. These points were chosen to illustrate  the thermal history at a variety of distances from the turnaround  regions and part surface. Fig. 6. shows that the ground truth  temperature (represented in orange) aligns closely with the  LSTM predictions (shown in blue). The accompanying shaded  region illustrates the uncertainty bounds, which are derived  using a 95% confidence interval. By examining these diagrams,  it is evident that while the model offers a reasonable  approximation of the actual temperature profiles, the prediction  quality is poorer when the laser is further from the node under  investigation, with predictions tending to be higher than the  ground truth simulation.  For effective prediction of the internal temperatures of the  fabricated  part—temperatures  which  are  inherently  unobservable—the model can leverage prior temperature  estimations from the Bayesian LSTM to subsequently predict  Fig. 6.

This sequential prediction will be  important when interfaced with the physical plant. While the  main emphasis of this study revolves around surface  temperatures, where prior temperatures are assumed to be  known, the LSTM may also be run using the temperature  predictions at previous time steps as input. As shown in Fig. 7,  the model reliably predicts internal temperatures with a  confidence level of ninety-five percent for six seconds.  Although the model demonstrates high predictive accuracy  overall, the model's reliance on its own outputs results in  substantial error accumulation past the first temperature peak.  In the digital twin context, the Bayesian LSTM model serves  as a critical predictive tool for advanced manufacturing. By  incorporating the Bayesian LSTM into the digital twin  framework, the system can proactively monitor thermal  behavior in real-time during DED processes and update its  understanding of system dynamics. This integration is vital for  precision in complex structures, where slight changes in  deposition conditions can greatly affect the properties of built  parts.  4. Bayesian Optimization for Time Series Process  Optimization (BOTSPO)  4.1 Description of the BOTSPO method:   Digital twin technology underlines the essential link  between offline analyses and online implementations. Offline  optimization fine-tunes parameters using historical data to  enhance online predictive control effectiveness [41,42].  Fundamentally,  offline  optimization  transcends  mere  preparatory operations, laying the foundation for the  performance of online optimization [43].  In this section, we develop a methodology to efficiently  represent the laser power profile utilizing a minimal set of  parameters as shown in Fig. 8. Within the BO framework, we  employ a Gaussian process (GP) model to capture the nonlinear  relationships between laser profile parameters and the desired  characteristics of laser profile along with their uncertainties,  thereby enabling robust and efficient exploration and  exploitation of the process design domain. In BO, as the  dimensionality of the parameter space increases, the  computational complexity of the GP inference grows  exponentially, leading to prohibitive computational overheads  [44]. This phenomenon, often referred to as the \"curse of  dimensionality,\" necessitates judicious selection of parameters  to ensure the optimization remains tractable and efficient. We  developed a Fourier series-based time series profile generator  for laser power, leveraging its ability to dissect signals into  sinusoids  for  clear  frequency  domain  analysis  and  reconstruction of complex laser behaviors.  To derive our time series generator, we start with a simple  Fourier series profile [45]. Fourier series offer immense  flexibility because they can approximate any periodic function  with a weighted sum of sines.    𝑦(𝑡) = 𝐴 D2 𝜋 F 1 𝑖 sin;2𝜋 ⋅ 𝑓 ⋅ 𝑖 ⋅ 𝑡 + (𝜙)> ) #5',# 89: 45' K  (3)    In the above Fourier series formula, the parameters A, n, f,  and ϕ represent the amplitude, number of terms, frequency, and  phase of the Fourier series respectively. To keep the number of  parameters low, and to increase the flexibility of the time series  profile generator we introduce 𝛥𝐴, 𝛥𝑓  and 𝛥𝜙 .    𝑦(𝑡) = (𝐴 + 𝑛Δ𝐴) 02 𝜋 3 1 𝑖 sin92𝜋(𝑓 + 𝑖𝛥𝑓)𝑖𝑡 + (𝜙 + 𝑖𝛥𝜙)= ' \"(),\" ,-. /() >  (4)     In the above time series generator, we employ a modified  Fourier  series  characterized  by  three  parameters: 𝛥𝐴, 𝛥𝑓, 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝛥𝜙. The 𝛥𝐴 parameter represents the  rate of change of amplitude, adding adaptability to the model  by allowing the amplitude to evolve over time. Concurrently,  𝛥𝑓  signifies the rate of change of frequency, enabling the  model to responsively adjust the oscillation frequency of the  laser power. Lastly, 𝛥𝜙 describes the rate of change of the  wave's phase, ensuring the model can compensate for temporal  shifts in the laser power profile for alignment with real-world  observations. The introduction of these rates of change  (Δparameters) provides the representation with the flexibility  to change its morphology gradually during the build while only  introducing a three new terms.  Temporal trends and seasonality are essential components  when modeling time series data, which comprises data points  listed at successive time intervals. A temporal trend, signified  by the term 𝑡 in the equation 𝑦;(𝑡) = 𝑦(𝑡) + 𝑇 ⋅ 𝑡, denotes a  consistent trajectory the data adheres to over time. The  coefficient 𝑇 represents the slope, capturing whether the laser  power profile gradually increases, decreases, or remains stable  over time. While the Fourier terms could theoretically capture  such a trend, explicitly implementing a linear trend reduces the  burden on the sinusoidal terms to represent noncyclic behavior.  On the other hand, seasonality captures recurring local  behavior in a time profile. This cyclic behavior is embodied in  the term 𝑆𝑠𝑖𝑛(2𝜋 ⋅ 𝑡 ⋅ 𝑆𝐹) in the equation. Here, 𝑆 adjusts the  amplitude of the seasonal fluctuation, SF represent the  frequency in which this cyclicity is captured, and the sine  function represents the cyclical pattern. Seasonality can also be  captured by a custom function if the underlying cyclic behavior  is known. By integrating both the temporal trend and  seasonality, the equation 𝑦;(𝑡)  provides a comprehensive  Fig. 7. Evaluation of Bayesian LSTM with its own temperature prediction as  an input to the LSTM  8  Author name / Manufacturing Letters 00 (2023) 000–000  portrayal of the laser power profile over time, ensuring the  digital twin closely mirrors real-world dynamics.    𝑦;(𝑡) = 𝑦(𝑡) + 𝑇𝑡 + 𝑆 sin(2𝜋𝑡 ⋅ 𝑆𝐹) (5)    In total, the system utilizes ten tunable parameters,  encompassing amplitude, frequency, phase, their rates of  change, and temporal dynamics to accurately capture and  represent the laser power profile over time, yielding a robust  and adaptive model for real-world applications.   The selection of ten parameters for the time series generator  was empirically determined to strike a balance between model  complexity and computational efficiency. These terms allow  for a sufficiently detailed representation of the laser power  profile (time series profile), capturing the essential dynamics  without overfitting, which is a common concern with more  parameters [46].   To optimize the time series laser power profile, we  employed BO, a model-based optimization approach for  maximizing GP Models. The GP Model function links the ten  adjustable parameters of our time series to the target objective.  Denoting the ten parameters as 𝑝 where 𝑝 = [𝑝', 𝑝4, … , 𝑝'<]  and the heat treatment time as 𝑓(𝑝), the GP Model will be,    𝑓(𝑝)~𝐺𝑃;𝑚(𝑝), 𝑘(𝑝, 𝑝;)> (6)    where 𝑚(𝑝)  is the mean function and 𝑘(𝑝, 𝑝;)  is the  covariance function or kernel. In our study, we employed the  radial basis function (RBF) [47]. The Radial Basis Function  (RBF) kernel is a covariance function used in Gaussian  processes that measures similarity based on the Euclidean  distance between points in the input space, with points closer  to each other having higher covariance. It is recommended to  set an upper limit, and lower limit of the ten parameters of the  time-series profile generator while linking the time-series  profile generator to the BOTSPO. The time-series profile  generator can generate a wide range of time series profiles  which might not be required for all the applications, and this  limit on the parameters should be made according to domain  knowledge.  Our optimization sequence, as outlined in Fig. 8, initiates  with Latin hypercube sampling to establish an initial Gaussian  Process (GP) model, setting the stage for capturing the  underlying function dynamics of the DED. Under this setup,  the Latin hypercube sampling method is employed to  efficiently cover the 10 dimensional parameter space. This  initial GP model then serves as a probabilistic surrogate for the  objective function, facilitating the estimation of both the  function's value and uncertainty across the parameter space.  Then, BO focuses on the objective function and leverages the  ten parameters to generate a respective time series laser profile.  Following the initialization phase, the BO process exploits the  GP posterior to identify regions in the parameter space that  likely contain optimal solutions. To make this selection, we  employ the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) as our acquisition  function, formulated as:    𝑈𝐶𝐵(𝑥) = 𝜇(𝑥) + 𝜅𝜎(𝑥) (7)    where 𝜇(𝑥)  is the GP posterior mean, 𝜎(𝑥)  represents the  standard deviation, and 𝜅  is an exploration-exploitation  parameter that dictates the trade-off between exploring  uncertain regions and exploiting known optima. By adjusting  𝜅 , we can finetune the balance between exploration and  exploitation in our optimization routine. As iterations progress,  the GP model is updated with the newly observed data, refining  the predictive landscape. The BO iteratively utilizes the UCB  acquisition function to select new samples, specifically  targeting regions that promise the most significant potential  improvement. It guides the search towards an optimal laser  power profile by aiming to maximize the UCB with respect to  the objective function as shown in equation (10) that is  characterized by the ten parameters.

Specifically, we designed an adaptive 𝜅, defined by:    𝜅=:>?@!A:(𝑖) = 𝛽\"=@A(𝑖) ⋅ (1 + 𝛼 ⋅ 𝜌) (8)  𝛽\"=@A(𝑖) = 𝛽< ⋅ 𝛾#  (9)                                                                  Here, 𝑖 denotes the iteration count, 𝛽< is a base value, 𝛾 is  the decay factor fixed at 0.90, and 𝜌 calculates the standard  deviation, which quantifies the mean uncertainty over the  previous five BOTSPO iterations. The uncertainty adjustment  factor 𝛼 is set to 0.1. By scaling 𝜅 with a base value 𝛽< and an  decay factor 𝛾#, we ensure that exploration is more aggressive  in early iterations to discover the potential regions of interest  and gradually becomes more refined. The inclusion of a  responsiveness factor 𝛼  multiplied by the recent prediction  uncertainty 𝜌  allows 𝜅  to adjust dynamically, promoting a  balance between exploration and exploitation based on the  evolving confidence in the model's predictions [44]. By  incorporating this adaptive approach, our optimization process  can respond flexibly to the changing dynamics and  uncertainties inherent in modeling of the DED process,  providing a more responsive and efficient search for optimal  laser profiles.   Striking an equilibrium between the exploration of  parameter domains and the exploitation of regions of high  performance is pivotal. BOTSPO's algorithmic architecture,  characterized by its adaptive mechanism, inherent noise  robustness, and sampling efficiency [41], is important for  manufacturing process optimization when the cost of collecting  data is high. This is particularly crucial for manufacturing  process optimization, where the cost of data collection is high.  The use of Bayesian methods allows BOTSPO to make  informed decisions about which points in the parameter space  to sample next, leveraging prior knowledge to improve both  exploration and exploitation strategies. In the next section, we  will look at the results achieved by the BOTSPO method in the  context of DED.  4.2 Results from the BOTSPO method  For our objective function, we aimed to maximize the heat  treatment time of the material used in the simulation, which is  defined as follows,    𝑇k = 1 𝑁 F 𝑟 m maxq𝑗s𝑇8#) ≤ 𝑑𝑓#> ≤ 𝑇8=Bu − minq𝑗s𝑇8#) ≤ 𝑑𝑓#> ≤ 𝑇8=Buv   C #5'   (10)    Where  𝑇k is the heat treatment time, 𝑁 is the total number of  nodes, 𝑟  is the data collection rate, 𝑇8#) and 𝑇8=B are the  minimum and maximum temperatures of the desired range,  𝑑𝑓#> is the temperature at the 𝑗 − 𝑡ℎ index for the 𝑖 − 𝑡ℎ node,  min{𝑗|𝑇8#) ≤ 𝑑𝑓#\" ≤ 𝑇8=B})  is the first index where the  temperature is within the desired range of the 𝑖 − 𝑡ℎ node, and  max{𝑗|𝑇8#) ≤ 𝑑𝑓#\" ≤ 𝑇8=B})  is the last index where the  temperature is within the desired range of the 𝑖 − 𝑡ℎ node.    In DED of IN718, multiple precipitates drive improved  strength in IN718, including the body centered tetragonal  Ni3Nb 𝛾′′ phase, which directly improves material strength  [48], and the orthorhombic Ni3Nb 𝛿 phase, whose plate-like  morphology has been demonstrated to cut up brittle Nb-rich  Laves phases, thus improving the effectiveness of post-build  heat treatments [4]. Xie et al. [49], identified using data-driven  techniques that the local strength of IN718 parts made using  laser-powder DED was related to the time spent between 654°C  and 857 °C. As typical aging times for IN718 are in the range  of hours at the effective soak temperatures [50] the objective  was set to strictly maximize the in-situ age time.   In Fig. 10, we present the BO progression, illustrating the  advancement of the laser power profiles from the preliminary  first iteration to the concluding 50th iteration. Initially, the GP  model is trained utilizing a dataset of 50 laser power profile  samples prior to its integration into the BOTSPO algorithm.  This pre-training of the GP Model is imperative as it establishes  a foundational understanding of the underlying parameter  space, facilitating more informed and efficient exploratory  decisions in subsequent optimization stages.   In Fig. 10, the BO function call history is delineated. In the  preliminary iterations, there is a predominant focus on  exploration to determine the optimal power profile to maximize  the heat treatment time. Later stages exhibit plateaus, indicating  a stable state and exploitation. A notable strength of BO, and  subsequently BOTSPO, lies in its sample efficiency: it requires  fewer data points relative to traditional techniques, thus  achieving optimal parameter discernment at a reduced  computational expense.  The parameters outlined in Table 1 control the build quality  by influencing the laser power profile in the DED process. The  \"Amplitude of Fourier (A)\" sets the base intensity of the laser;  a higher amplitude translates to more energy input, essential for  initial layers. The \"Frequency of Fourier (f)\" controls the  Fig. 9.

The \"Rates of Change for  Frequency (Δf)\" adapts the laser's temporal response to the  evolving thermal profile.  In the optimum power sequence (Fig. 9, right), the laser  power is initially high. This is likely due to the longer heat  treatment times at the beginning of the thin-wall build, as  observed in previous works [20]. The optimizer thus sought to  maximize this effect by driving up the early laser power. As the  thin wall build progressed, the radiative and convective heat  transfer increased; like a fin, the build became more efficient in  rejecting heat and the amount of time in the heat treatment  range decreased for the higher locations. The optimizer thus did  not seek to increase the laser power in later parts of the build,  as even laser powers at the top of the specified range did not  substantially improve the total heat treatment duration.  This result, while increasing the average heat treatment  duration in the part, does not achieve material homogeneity.  Future work on the BOTSPO will implement multi-objective  optimization that can balance joint objectives of maximizing  heat treatment duration and homogeneity, thus preventing the  front-biased result in this work.  Utilizing the proposed methodology allows us to determine  an offline laser power profile, serving as a foundational process  trajectory for online predictive control during the laser-based  additive manufacturing process. This process trajectory can  streamline real-time adjustments, enhancing consistent  deposition quality and decreasing potential discrepancies  arising from fluctuating process dynamics in laser-based  additive manufacturing.  4. Conclusion       In this paper, we proposed a digital twin framework for  DED process control and optimization, an autonomous and  systematic approach that enables repeatable fabrication of  complex parts. This paper contributes two major components  of implementing the overall digital twin framework: a data- driven, surrogate model that enables dynamic prediction of  temperatures with uncertainty quantification throughout the  part in real-time, and a Bayesian Optimization Method for  Time Series Process Optimization (BOTSPO) that determines  appropriate laser power profiles for maximizing the part’s  precipitation hardening time.   First, we developed a Bayesian LSTM based surrogate  model which is capable of temperature prediction for selected  areas of the built part in real-time. The Bayesian LSTM model  is laser profile-agnostic and is capable of accurate location- based temperature prediction for simple geometries like thin  walls. We demonstrated the capability by training and  analyzing the predictive capabilities of the Bayesian LSTM  model on a thin wall geometry with an 𝑅4  score of 0.75. This  surrogate modelling capability will enable real-time MPC in  the online digital system when online monitoring information  becomes available. The distinctiveness of our Bayesian LSTM  lies in its architecture that not only retrospectively considers  measurable states and input variables but also adeptly  understands the spatial-temporal dynamics inherent to the DED  process. It has been designed to provide emphasis on  significant historical events, while also quantifying the inherent  model uncertainty—a critical feature for making informed  decisions in a digital twin environment. Unlike traditional  LSTMs, our model incorporates Bayesian inference principles  through the implementation of Monte Carlo dropout  techniques. This allows for an approximation of Bayesian  posterior distributions, thereby furnishing a quantifiable  measure of uncertainty in its predictions, which is important for  optimizing the manufacturing process.  Secondly, we introduced BOTSPO, which efficiently  identifies optimized laser power profiles to enhance heat  treatment and precipitation hardening. Given the computational  demands of high-fidelity FEM models, BOTSPO is engineered  to ascertain optimal profiles with minimal function evaluations.  Addressing the potentially infinite dimensionality of time  series profiles, we employ a dimension reduction strategy by  devising a time series profile generator that leverages a set of  10 parameters, facilitating a comprehensive exploration of the  time series space without incurring prohibitive computational  costs. This approach is crucial as BO's efficiency inversely  correlates with the number of parameters to optimize. We  tested this approach with the objective of maximizing the heat  treatment time for the thin-wall IN718 build and found that the  Table 1.

The off- line process optimization result will serve as the reference  process trajectory in online model predictive control.  Future work will focus on the integration of the methods  presented in this paper with a physical DED system. For  physical realization of a DED-DT systems, there are additional  tasks to be considered, including online optimization of the  laser power profile, continuous model update using both online  and off-line data, and drift correction of the surrogate model via  model update from a more accurate sub-real-time model.
