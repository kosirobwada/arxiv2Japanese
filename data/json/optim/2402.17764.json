These models have demonstrated remarkable performance in a wide range of natural\nlanguage processing tasks, but their increasing size has posed challenges for deployment and raised\nconcerns about their environmental and economic impact due to high energy consumption. One\napproach to address these challenges is to use post-training quantization to create low-bit models\nfor inference [XLS+23, FAHA23, CCKS23, TCS+24]. This technique reduces the precision of\nweights and activations, significantly reducing the memory and computational requirements of LLMs.\nThe trend has been to move from 16 bits to lower bits, such as 4-bit variants [FAHA23, LTT+23].\nHowever, post-training quantization is sub-optimal, even though it is widely used in industry LLMs.\nRecent work on 1-bit model architectures, such as BitNet [WMD+23], presents a promising direction\nfor reducing the cost of LLMs while maintaining their performance. Vanilla LLMs are in 16-bit\nfloating values (i.e., FP16 or BF16), and the bulk of any LLMs is matrix multiplication. Therefore,\nthe major computation cost comes from the floating-point addition and multiplication operations. In\ncontrast, the matrix multiplication of BitNet only involves integer addition, which saves orders of\nenergy cost for LLMs. As the fundamental limit to compute performance in many chips is power, the\nenergy savings can also be translated into faster computation.\nIn addition to computation, the process of transferring model parameters from DRAM to the memory\nof an on-chip accelerator (e.g., SRAM) can be expensive during inference. There have been attempts\nto enlarge SRAM to improve throughput, but this introduces significantly higher costs than DRAM.\nCompared to full-precision models, 1-bit LLMs have a much lower memory footprint from both a\ncapacity and bandwidth standpoint. This can significantly reduce the cost and time of loading weights\nfrom DRAM, leading to faster and more efficient inference.\nIn this work, we introduce a significant 1-bit LLM variant called BitNet b1.58, where every parameter\nis ternary, taking on values of {-1, 0, 1}. We have added an additional value of 0 to the original 1-bit\nBitNet, resulting in 1.58 bits in the binary system. BitNet b1.58 retains all the benefits of the original\n1-bit BitNet, including its new computation paradigm, which requires almost no multiplication\noperations for matrix multiplication and can be highly optimized. Additionally, it has the same energy\nconsumption as the original 1-bit BitNet and is much more efficient in terms of memory consumption,\nthroughput and latency compared to FP16 LLM baselines. Furthermore, BitNet b1.58 offers two\nadditional advantages. Firstly, its modeling capability is stronger due to its explicit support for feature\nfiltering, made possible by the inclusion of 0 in the model weights, which can significantly improve\nthe performance of 1-bit LLMs. Secondly, our experiments show that BitNet b1.58 can match full\nprecision (i.e., FP16) baselines in terms of both perplexity and end-task performance, starting from a\n3B size, when using the same configuration (e.g., model size, training tokens, etc.).\n2\nBitNet b1.58\nBitNet b1.58 is based on the BitNet architecture, which is a Transformer that replaces nn.Linear with\nBitLinear. It is trained from scratch, with 1.58-bit weights and 8-bit activations. Compared to the\noriginal BitNet, it introduces some modifications that we summarize below.\nQuantization Function.\nTo constrain the weights to -1, 0, or +1, we adopt an absmean quantization\nfunction. It first scales the weight matrix by its average absolute value, and then round each value to\nthe nearest integer among {-1, 0, +1}:\nf\nW = RoundClip( W\nγ + ϵ, −1, 1),\n(1)\nRoundClip(x, a, b) = max(a, min(b, round(x))),\n(2)\nγ =\n1\nnm\nX\nij\n|Wij|.\n(3)\nThe quantization function for activations follows the same implementation in BitNet, except that\nwe do not scale the activations before the non-linear functions to the range [0, Qb].

This is\nmore convenient and simple for both implementation and system-level optimization, while introduces\nnegligible effects to the performance in our experiments.\nLLaMA-alike Components.\nThe architecture of LLaMA [TLI+23, TMS+23] has been the de-\nfacto backbone for open-source LLMs.\nTo embrace the open-source community, our design\nof BitNet b1.58 adopts the LLaMA-alike components. Specifically, it uses RMSNorm [ZS19],\nSwiGLU [Sha20], rotary embedding [SAL+24], and removes all biases. In this way, BitNet b1.58\ncan be integrated into the popular open-source software (e.g., Huggingface, vLLM [KLZ+23], and\nllama.cpp2) with minimal efforts.\n3\nResults\nWe compared BitNet b1.58 to our reproduced FP16 LLaMA LLM in various sizes. To ensure a fair\ncomparison, we pre-trained the models on the RedPajama dataset [Com23] for 100 billion tokens.\nWe evaluated the zero-shot performance on a range of language tasks, including ARC-Easy [YBS19],\nARC-Challenge [YBS19], Hellaswag [ZHB+19], Winogrande [SBBC20], PIQA [BZB+19], Open-\nbookQA [MCKS18], and BoolQ [CLC+19]. We also reported the validation perplexity on the\nWikiText2 [MXBS16] and C4 [RSR+19] datasets.\nWe compared the runtime GPU memory and latency of both LLaMA LLM and BitNet b1.58. The\nresults were measured using the FasterTransformer3 codebase, which is well-optimized for LLM\ninference latency on GPU devices. The 2-bit kernel from Ladder [WMC+23] is also integrated for\nBitNet b1.58. We reported the time per output token, as it is the major cost for inference.\nTable 1 summarizes the perplexity and the cost for BitNet b1.58 and LLaMA LLM. It shows that\nBitNet b1.58 starts to match full precision LLaMA LLM at 3B model size in terms of perplexity,\nwhile being 2.71 times faster and using 3.55 times less GPU memory. In particular, BitNet b1.58 with\na 3.9B model size is 2.4 times faster, consumes 3.32 times less memory, but performs significantly\nbetter than LLaMA LLM 3B.\n2https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp\n3https://github.com/NVIDIA/FasterTransformer\n3\n1.3B\n3B\n7B\n13B\n70B\nModel Size\n100\n101\n102\nLatency (ms)\n1.67x\n2.71x\n2.90x\n3.68x\n4.10x\nBitNet b1.58\nLLaMA\n1.3B\n3B\n7B\n13B\n70B\nModel Size\n100\n101\n102\nMemory (GB)\n2.93x\n3.55x\n4.40x\n5.12x\n7.16x\nBitNet b1.58\nLLaMA\nFigure 2: Decoding latency (Left) and memory consumption (Right) of BitNet b1.58 varying the\nmodel size.\nModels\nSize\nMax Batch Size\nThroughput (tokens/s)\nLLaMA LLM\n70B\n16 (1.0x)\n333 (1.0x)\nBitNet b1.58\n70B\n176 (11.0x)\n2977 (8.9x)\nTable 3: Comparison of the throughput between BitNet b1.58 70B and LLaMA LLM 70B.\nTable 2 reports the detailed results of the zero-shot accuracy on the end tasks. We followed the pipeline\nfrom lm-evaluation-harness4 to perform the evaluation. The results show that the performance gap\nbetween BitNet b1.58 and LLaMA LLM narrows as the model size increases. More importantly,\nBitNet b1.58 can match the performance of the full precision baseline starting from a 3B size. Similar\nto the observation of the perplexity, the end-task results reveal that BitNet b1.58 3.9B outperforms\nLLaMA LLM 3B with lower memory and latency cost. This demonstrates that BitNet b1.58 is a\nPareto improvement over the state-of-the-art LLM models.\nMemory and Latency\nWe further scaled up the model size to 7B, 13B, and 70B and evaluated the\ncost. Figure 2 illustrates the trends of latency and memory, showing that the speed-up increases as the\nmodel size scales. In particular, BitNet b1.58 70B is 4.1 times faster than the LLaMA LLM baseline.\nThis is because the time cost for nn.Linear grows with the model size. The memory consumption\nfollows a similar trend, as the embedding remains full precision and its memory proportion is smaller\nfor larger models. Both latency and memory were measured with a 2-bit kernel, so there is still room\nfor optimization to further reduce the cost.\nEnergy\nWe also estimate the arithmetic operations energy consumption of both BitNet b1.58 and\nLLaMA LLM. We focus mainly on the calculation for matrix multiplication, since it contributes\nthe most to the cost of LLMs. Figure 3 illustrates the composition of the energy cost. The majority\nof BitNet b1.58 is INT8 addition calculation, while LLaMA LLM consists of both FP16 addition\nand FP16 multiplication. According to the energy model in [Hor14, ZZL22], BitNet b1.58 saves\n71.4 times arithmetic operations energy consumption for matrix multiplication on 7nm chips. We\nfurther reported the end-to-end energy cost for models with 512 tokens. Our results show that as the\nmodel size scales, BitNet b1.58 becomes increasingly more efficient in terms of energy consumption\ncompared to the FP16 LLaMA LLM baseline. This is due to the fact that the percentage of nn.Linear\ngrows with the model size, while the cost from other components is smaller for larger models.\nThroughput\nWe compare the throughput of BitNet b1.58 and LLaMA LLM with 70B parameters\non two 80GB A100 cards, using pipeline parallelism [HCB+19] so that LLaMA LLM 70B could be\nrun on the devices. We increased the batch size until the GPU memory limit was reached, with a\nsequence length of 512. Table 3 shows that BitNet b1.58 70B can support up to 11 times the batch\nsize of LLaMA LLM, resulting an 8.9 times higher throughput.\n4https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness\n4\nBitNet b1.58\nLLaMA\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n7nm Energy Cost (pJ)\n71.4x\nINT8 Add\nFP16 Add\nFP16 Mul\n1.3B\n3B\n7B\n13B\n70B\nModel Size\n10\n1\n100\n101\nEnergy (J)\n18.6x\n21.7x\n29.1x\n32.9x\n41.2x\nBitNet b1.58\nLLaMA\nFigure 3: Energy consumption of BitNet b1.58 compared to LLaMA LLM at 7nm process nodes.

As a reference, we can have the following equivalence between different model sizes in 1.58-bit\nand 16-bit based on the results in Figure 2 and 3.\n• 13B BitNet b1.58 is more efficient, in terms of latency, memory usage and energy consump-\ntion, than 3B FP16 LLM.\n• 30B BitNet b1.58 is more efficient, in terms of latency, memory usage and energy consump-\ntion, than 7B FP16 LLM.\n• 70B BitNet b1.58 is more efficient, in terms of latency, memory usage and energy consump-\ntion, than 13B FP16 LLM.\nTraining with 2T Tokens\nThe number of training tokens is a crucial factor for LLMs. To test\nthe scalability of BitNet b1.58 in terms of tokens, we trained a BitNet b1.58 model with 2T to-\nkens following the data recipe of StableLM-3B [TBMR], which is the state-of-the-art open-source\n3B model. Both models were evaluated on a benchmark that consists of Winogrande [SBBC20],\nPIQA [BZB+19], SciQ [WLG17], LAMBADA [PKL+16], and ARC-easy [YBS19]. We reported\nthe zero-shot accuracy in Table 4. For tasks measured with accuracy and normalized accuracy, we\ntake the average of the two. The results of StableLM 3b at 2T tokens are taken directly from its\ntechnical report. Our findings shows that BitNet b1.58 achieves a superior performance on all end\ntasks, indicating that 1.58-bit LLMs also have strong generalization capabilities.\n4\nDiscussion and Future Work\n1-bit Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) have proven to be a cost-effective approach for LLMs. While it signifi-\ncantly reduces the computation FLOPs, the high memory consumption and inter-chip communication\noverhead limit its deployment and application. These challenges can be addressed by 1.58-bit LLMs.\nFirstly, the reduced memory footprint reduces the number of devices required to deploy MoE models.\nMoreover, it significantly reduces the overhead of transferring activations across networks. Ultimately,\nthere would be no overhead if the entire models could be placed on a single chip.\n5\nNative Support of Long Sequence in LLMs\nIn the era of LLMs, the ability to handle long sequence has become a critical demand. One major\nchallenge for long sequence inference is the memory consumption introduced by the KV caches.\nBitNet b1.58 represents a significant step towards native support for long sequences, as it reduces the\nactivations from 16 bits to 8 bits, allowing the context length to be doubled given the same resources.\nThis can be further losslessly compressed to 4 bits or even lower for 1.58-bit LLMs, which we leave\nas future work.\nLLMs on Edge and Mobile\nThe use of 1.58-bit LLMs has the potential to greatly improve the performance of language models\non edge and mobile devices. These devices are often limited by their memory and computational\npower, which can restrict the performance and the scale of LLMs. However, the reduced memory and\nenergy consumption of 1.58-bit LLMs allows them to be deployed on these devices, enabling a wide\nrange of applications that were previously not possible. This can greatly enhance the capabilities\nof edge and mobile devices and enable new and exciting applications of LLMs. Moreover, 1.58-bit\nLLMs are more friendly to CPU devices, which are the main processors used in edge and mobile\ndevices. This means that BitNet b1.58 can be efficiently executed on these devices, further improving\ntheir performance and capabilities.\nNew Hardware for 1-bit LLMs\nRecent work like Groq5 has demonstrated promising results and great potential for building specific\nhardware (e.g., LPUs) for LLMs. Going one step further, we envision and call for actions to design\nnew hardware and system specifically optimized for 1-bit LLMs, given the new computation paradigm\nenabled in BitNet [WMD+23].\nReferences\n[BZB+19] Yonatan Bisk, Rowan Zellers, Ronan Le Bras, Jianfeng Gao, and Yejin Choi.
