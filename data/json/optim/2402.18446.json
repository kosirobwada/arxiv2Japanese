It has consistently been a crucial research direction to understand\nthe power and limits of quantum operations that can be implemented by local operations and classical\ncommunication (LOCC), e.g., in quantum state discrimination [1–10].\nIn quantum state discrimination tasks, one usually performs a binary-valued positive-operator valued\nmeasure (POVM) on the received state and then decides which state it is according to the measurement\noutcome. Quantum state discrimination has led to fruitful applications in quantum cryptography [11–13],\nquantum dimension witness [14, 15] and quantum data hiding [16–18]. To understand the underlying\nmechanism of quantum state discrimination, various operations that encompass LOCC are further con-\nsidered due to its complex structure, including POVMs that are separable (SEP) [19, 20], and POVMs\nwith positive partial transpose (PPT) [21–23]. There is a strict inclusion among them as [1],\nLOCC ⊆ SEP ⊆ PPT ⊆ ALL.\n(1)\nNotably, PPT POVMs enjoy a much simpler mathematical structure than LOCC and SEP as the former\ncan be completely characterized by semidefinite programming (SDP) [24]. In particular, the distin-\nguishability of quantum states under a restricted family of measurements is closely related to quantum\ndata hiding [25,26], which is originally based on the existence of pairs of bipartite states that are perfectly\ndistinguishable with general entangled measurements yet indistinguishable by LOCC. In the context of\nbipartite state discrimination, the utility of a shared entangled state is paramount as it can significantly\nimprove limited local distinguishability, potentially matching the efficacy of general entangled measure-\nments. Notably, a maximally entangled state is often a universal resource for such enhancements [3,27].\nThis leads to a compelling and crucial question:\nHow much entanglement at minimum do we need to unlock this quantum data hiding?\nDue to the complex structure of LOCC and entanglement, our understanding of the role of entangle-\nment in quantum state discrimination is still limited. Currently, the entanglement cost is only known for\na small number of ensembles of quantum states, with a focus on the set that contains at least one of the\nfour Bell states. Specifically, it has been shown that Bell basis [28] and a set of three Bell states [19]\ncan be distinguished with the assistance of 1 ebit. For quantum states with higher dimensions, Ref. [21]\nshows that 1 ebit suffices for discriminating a d ⊗ d pure state and its orthogonal complement perfectly\nby PPT POVMs. For other special cases, Ref. [29] demonstrates that 1 ebit is required for the optimal\ndiscrimination for a noisy Bell state ensemble by LOCC.\nIn this paper, we study the entanglement cost of optimally discriminating two arbitrary quantum\nstates by PPT POVMs, which is also the lower bound for the scenario of employing LOCC. Firstly,\nwe introduce the spectral PPT-distance of a POVM which can be efficiently computed via SDP and\ncharacterizes the PPT-ness of a general POVM. Secondly, we formally define the entanglement cost of\noptimal discriminating a set of states via measurements under locality constraints. We show that the\nspectral PPT-distance of a POVM can be utilized to derive a lower bound on the entanglement cost of\noptimal discrimination by PPT POVMs. Thirdly, we provide an upper bound on the entanglement cost\nof optimal discrimination by PPT POVMs which is directly determined by the spectrum properties of\nthe given states. Leveraging this upper bound, we show that a pure state can be optimally discriminated\nagainst any other state with the assistance of 1 ebit.\n2\nPreliminaries\nNotations.\nWe use A and B to denote finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces HA and HB associated with\nthe systems of Alice and Bob, respectively. The dimensions of HA and HB are denoted as dA and\ndB. A quantum state on system A is a positive semidefinite operator ρA with trace one. The support\nof ρA, denoted as supp(ρA), is defined as the space spanned by the eigenvectors of ρA with positive\neigenvalues. Let {|j⟩}j=0,··· ,d−1 be a standard computational basis, then a standard maximally entangled\n2\n𝜌0, 𝜌1?\nA\nB\nMaximally \nEntangled States\n𝑃suc = optimal\nFig 1: Illustration of the entanglement-assisted quantum state discrimination task. Alice and Bob (repre-\nsented as A and B) aim to discriminate bipartite quantum states ρ0 and ρ1. Commencing with an initial\nallocation of entanglement resources, the optimal discrimination achievable through a general entangled\nmeasurement is demonstrated to be attainable by employing measurements under locality constraints,\nshowcasing the pivotal role of entanglement consumption in the discrimination process.\nstate of Schmidt rank d is Φ+\nd = 1/d Pd−1\ni,j=0 |ii⟩⟨jj|. A bipartite quantum state ρAB is said to be Positive-\nPartial-Transpose (PPT) if ρTB\nAB ≥ 0 where TB denotes taking partial transpose on the subsystem B.\nQuantum State Discrimination.\nQuantum measurements are described by positive-operator-valued-\nmeasure (POVM). A POVM with n elements is denoted as E = {Ej}n−1\nj=0 where Ej ≥ 0 and P\nj Ej =\nI. Suppose Ω = {(pj, ρj)}n−1\nj=0 is an ensemble of n quantum states ρ0 . . . ρn−1 given with associated\nprobability p0 . . . pn−1. In the task of quantum state discrimination, we usually apply a POVM on a given\nunknown state ρj with prior probability pj and decide which state it is according to the measurement\noutcomes. In the context of minimum-error state discrimination (MSD), the goal is to maximize the\naverage success probability, given by\nPsuc(Ω) = max\n{Ej}\nn−1\nX\nj=0\npj Tr(ρjEj).\n(2)\nNotably, the celebrated result in Ref. [30] shows that optimal discrimination success probability of dis-\ncriminating two quantum states {ρ0, ρ1} with prior probability p0 and p1 is given by 1\n2(1 + ∥p0ρ0 −\np1ρ1∥1), where ∥·∥1 denotes the trace norm. The corresponding POVM is called the Helstrom measure-\nments. It can be expressed by M+ and M−, where M+ is the projection on the positive eigenspace of\np0ρ0 − p1ρ1 and M− = I − M+.\nWe denote E(HA) as the set of all positive semidefinite Hermitian matrices on HA that satisfy 0 ≤\nE ≤ I, ∀E ∈ E(HA). It is easy to see that E(HA) is a convex set and we will use the notation E as\na shorthand for E(HA) when there is no ambiguity for the Hilbert space. Considering POVMs under\nlocality constraints acting on a bipartite system AB, we denote ELOCC as the set of all elements of\nLOCC POVMs [31] which includes strategies based on measurement outcomes performed locally on\neach subsystem. We denote\nESEP(HA ⊗ HB) :=\n(\nE(k)\nA ⊗ E(k)\nB\n: E(k)\nA\n≥ 0, E(k)\nB\n≥ 0,\nX\nk\nE(k)\nA ⊗ E(k)\nB\n= I\n)\n(3)\nas the set of all elements for SEP POVMs [32] and\nEPPT(HA ⊗ HB) :=\nn\nEAB : 0 ≤ EAB ≤ IAB, 0 ≤ ETB\nAB ≤ IAB\no\n(4)\nas the set of all elements for PPT POVMs [32].\n3\n3\nSpectral PPT-distance of a POVM\nTo investigate the capability of measurements under locality constraints, we first focus on the charac-\nterization of the localness of a POVM. In light of the favorable mathematical characterization of PPT\nPOVMs, we introduce the generalized PPT-distance of a POVM as follows.\nDefinition 1 (Generalized PPT-distance) Given a POVM M = {Mj}n−1\nj=0 acting on a bipartite system\nHA ⊗ HB, its generalized PPT-distance is defined as\nD(M) = min\n\u001a\nr\n\f\f\f\f ∆(MTB\nj\n, ETB\nj\n) ≤ r,\nn−1\nX\nj=0\nEj = I, Ej ∈ EPPT, ∀j\n\u001b\n,\n(5)\nwhere ∆(·, ·) is a metric that satisfies positive-definiteness, symmetry, and triangle inequality. The mini-\nmization ranges over all possible {Ej}j.\nParticularly, an essential metric is the distance induced by the Schatten p-norms, i.e.,\n∥X∥p =\n\u0010\nTr\nh\n(X†X)\np\n2\ni\u0011 1\np , p ∈ [1, ∞).\n(6)\nThis family includes the three most commonly used distances in quantum information theory, i.e., the\ntrace distance, the Frobenius distance, and the spectral distance. The Schatten-p PPT-distance is denoted\nas Dp(M) for ∆(MTB\nj\n, ETB\nj\n) := ∥MTB\nj\n−ETB\nj\n∥p. Its geometric interpretation is depicted in Fig. 2. For\np = ∞ where ∥ · ∥∞ corresponds to a fundamentally important norm of the spectral norm, we have the\nspectral PPT-distance of a POVM as follows.\nDefinition 2 (Spectral PPT-distance) Given a POVM M = {Mj}n−1\nj=0 acting on a bipartite system\nHA ⊗ HB, its spectral PPT-distance is defined as\nD∞(M) = min\n\u001a\nr\n\f\f\f\f\n\r\r\rMTB\nj\n− ETB\nj\n\r\r\r\n∞ ≤ r,\nn−1\nX\nj=0\nEj = I, Ej ∈ EPPT, ∀j\n\u001b\n,\n(7)\nwhere the minimization ranges over all possible {Ej}j.\nThe spectral PPT-distance of a POVM bears nice properties. Firstly, it is efficiently computable via\nSDP and quantifies the proximity of a given POVM to the set of PPT POVMs. Specifically, D∞(M) is\nfaithful, i.e., D∞(M) ≥ 0 and D∞(M) = 0 if and only if M is a PPT POVM. Secondly, it is invariant\nunder local unitaries which is directly obtained by the local unitary invariance of the spectral norm and\nPPT-ness of Ej. Thirdly, for two POVMs M0 = {M0,j}n−1\nj=0 and M1 = {M1,j}n−1\nj=0 , we denote a convex\ncombination of them as c\nM = αM0 + (1 − α)M1 := { c\nMj}n−1\nj=0 where c\nMj = αM0,j + (1 − α)M1,j;\ndenote the tensor product of them as f\nM = M0 ⊗ M1 := {f\nMjk}n−1\nj,k=0 where f\nMjk = M0,j ⊗ M1,k.\nWe show that D∞(M) is convex w.r.t. the convex combination and linearly subadditive w.r.t. the tensor\nproduct of POVMs.\nProposition 1 (Convexity) For POVMs M0, M1 acting on a bipartite system HA⊗HB and 0 ≤ α ≤ 1,\nD∞(αM0 + (1 − α)M1) ≤ α · D∞(M0) + (1 − α) · D∞(M1).\n(8)\nProposition 2 (Linearly subadditivity) For POVMs M0 = {M0,j}j, M1 = {M1,k}k acting on a\nbipartite system HA ⊗ HB,\nD∞(M0 ⊗ M1) ≤ ξ · D∞(M0) + ζ · D∞(M1),\n(9)\nwhere ξ = maxk(1 + ∥MTB\n1,k ∥∞)/2 and ζ = maxj(1 + ∥MTB\n0,j ∥∞)/2.\n4\n𝑀\n𝑀𝑇𝐵\n𝑘1\n𝐼 − 𝑀\n𝐼 − 𝑀 𝑇𝐵\n𝑘2\n𝐼 − 𝐸\n𝐸\nℰPPT\nℰ\nFig 2: The spectral PPT-distance of a given binary-valued POVM M = {M, I − M}. It is defined as\nthe minimum spectral distance from the partial transpose of M, I − M to the set of PPT POVMs. That\nis, D∞(M) = min max{k1, k2} where the minimization ranges over all possible choices of E, I − E ∈\nEPPT. Each POVM is associated with a pair of points in the set, connected by a dashed line that intersects\nthe origin point I/2.\n4\nEntanglement cost of PPT discrimination\nNow, we study the amount of entanglement required to discriminate a set of quantum states by PPT\nPOVMs optimally. Herein, optimality refers to achieving the maximal average success probability with-\nout any restrictions on POVMs. We note the spectral PPT-distance of a POVM provides insights into\nthe minimum amount of entanglement required to promote a PPT POVM to the given POVM. We will\ndemonstrate this aspect through its application in quantum state discrimination tasks in the following.\nRecall the optimal average success probability of discriminating two quantum states is given by\nEq. (2) when there are no restrictions on the POVM one is allowed to perform. However, an inher-\nent challenge that arises in practice is the spatial distribution of quantum facilities, leading to the con-\nstraint that each laboratory can execute local quantum operations with mutual classical communication\navailable. This motivates us to consider POVMs under locality constraints, including LOCC POVMs,\nSEP POVMs, and PPT POVMs as illustrated in Eq. (1). Despite extensive research characterizing the\nminimum amount of entanglement required to discriminate quantum states by POVMs under locality\nconstraints [19, 21, 29, 33, 34], a quantitative analysis is still lacking. To address this problem, we first\nintroduce the entanglement-assisted average success probability where two parties are allowed to share\nentanglement to assist their QSD tasks.\nDefinition 3 (Entanglement-assisted average success probability) Given a quantum state ensemble\nΩ = {(pj, ρj)}n−1\nj=0 , where pj ≥ 0 and P\nj pj = 1, and a positive integer k ≥ 2, the entanglement-\nassisted average success probability of discriminating Ω via operation class Π is defined as\nP Π\nsuc,e(Ω; k) = max\n{Ej}∈Π\nn−1\nX\nj=0\npj Tr[Ej(ρj ⊗ Φ+\nk )],\n(10)\nwhere {Ej}n−1\nj=0 is a POVM, Π ∈ {LOCC, SEP, PPT}.\nWe also denote P Π\nsuc(Ω) as the optimal average success probability when using POVMs in Π. Then\nit is natural to formally define the entanglement cost of optimal Π-discrimination by considering how\nmuch entanglement it needs to render this entanglement-assisted average success probability identical to\nthe original optimal success probability with no restrictions on POVMs.\nDefinition 4 (Entanglement cost of optimal Π-discrimination) Given a quantum state ensemble Ω =\n{(pj, ρj)}n−1\nj=0 , where pj ≥ 0 and P\nj pj = 1, the entanglement cost of optimal Π-discrimination is\ndefined as\nEΠ\nC(Ω) = min\n\b\nlog k : P Π\nsuc,e(Ω; k) = Psuc(Ω), k ≥ 2\n\t\n.\n(11)\nIf P Π\nsuc(Ω) = Psuc(Ω), then EΠ\nC(Ω) is set to be zero.\n5\nThroughout the paper, we take the logarithm to be base two unless stated otherwise. In particular, con-\nsider the scenario of discriminating a pair of quantum states ρ0 and ρ1 given with the same prior proba-\nbility as the results for asymmetric probabilities can be easily generalized. We write the entanglement-\nassisted average success probability of discriminating ρ0 and ρ1 by PPT POVMs as P PPT\nsuc,e(ρ0, ρ1; k) and\nestablish its SDP form in the following Proposition 3. The derivation of its dual form can be found in\nAppendix A.\nProposition 3 Given two bipartite quantum states ρ0, ρ1 with the same prior probability, the\nentanglement-assisted average success probability of PPT-discrimination is\nP PPT\nsuc,e(ρ0, ρ1; k) = max\nWi,Qi\n1\n2 Tr(ρ0W0 + ρ1W1)\ns.t.\n\n\n\n\n\nWj, Qj ∈ E, j = 0, 1,\nW0 + W1 = Q0 + Q1 = I,\n− kQTB\nj\n≤ W TB\nj\n− QTB\nj\n≤ kQTB\nj .\n(12)\nProof By definition, the entanglement-assisted average success probability by PPT POVMs can be\ncomputed via the following SDP,\nP PPT\nsuc,e(ρ0, ρ1; k) = max 1\n2 + 1\n2 Tr\nh\nE[(ρ0 − ρ1) ⊗ Φ+\nk ]\ni\ns.t. 0 ≤ ETBB′ ≤ I,\n(13)\n0 ≤ E ≤ I,\nwhere Φ+\nk is the maximally entangled state on HA′ ⊗ HB′ with dA′ = dB′ = k. To further simplify the\noptimization problem, we notice that we can write\nTr[E((ρ0 − ρ1) ⊗ Φ+\nk )] = Tr[(ρ0 − ρ1) TrA′B′((IAB ⊗ Φ+\nk )E)].\n(14)\nSuppose eE is an optimal solution. Since Φ+\nk is invariant under any local unitary UA′ ⊗ U ∗\nB′, i.e., (UA′ ⊗\nU ∗\nB′)Φ+\nk (UA′ ⊗ U ∗\nB′)† = Φ+\nk , (UA′ ⊗ U ∗\nB′)E(UA′ ⊗ U ∗\nB′)† is also an optimal solution. Since any convex\ncombination of optimal solutions remains optimal, we have that\nZ\ndU(UA′ ⊗ U ∗\nB′)E(UA′ ⊗ U ∗\nB′)†\n(15)\nis optimal, where dU is the Haar measure. Then according to Schur’s lemma, we can restrict the optimal\neE as\neE = WAB ⊗ Φ+\nk + QAB ⊗ (I − Φ+\nk ),\n(16)\nwith certain linear operators WAB and QAB. It follows that\nTrA′B′[(IAB ⊗ Φ+\nk ) eE] = TrA′B′[(IAB ⊗ Φ+\nk )(WAB ⊗ Φ+\nk + QAB ⊗ (I − Φ+\nk ))] = WAB,\n(17)\nwhich can simplify the objective function as\nTr\n\u0002\n(ρ0 − ρ1) ⊗ Φ+\nk\n\u0003\n= Tr [(ρ0 − ρ1)WAB] .\n(18)\nBy spectral decomposition, we have (Φ+\nk )TB = (P+ − P−) /k, where P+ and P− are the symmetric and\nanti-symmetric projections respectively. Then it follows that\neETBB′ = W TB\nAB ⊗ (Φ+\nk )TB′ + QTB\nAB ⊗\n\u0000I − Φ+\nk\n\u0001TB′\n= W TB\nAB ⊗ P+ − P−\nk\n+ QTB\nAB ⊗ (k − 1)P+ + (k + 1)P−\nk\n=\nh\nW TB\nAB + (k − 1)QTB\nAB\ni\n⊗ P+\nk +\nh\n−W TB\nAB + (k + 1)QTB\nAB\ni\n⊗ P−\nk .\n(19)\n6\nSince P+ and P− are positive and orthogonal to each other, we have 0 ≤ eETBB′ ≤ I if and only if\n0 ≤ W TB\nAB + (k − 1)QTB\nAB ≤ kIAB,\n0 ≤ −W TB\nAB + (k + 1)QTB\nAB ≤ kIAB.\n(20)\nSimilarly, we have 0 ≤ eE ≤ I if and only if\n0 ≤ WAB ≤ IAB, 0 ≤ QAB ≤ IAB\n(21)\nCombining equations (20) and (21), the entanglement cost of optimal PPT-discrimination can be simpli-\nfied and calculated by the optimization problem.\n■\nBased on Proposition 3, the entanglement cost of optimal PPT-discrimination of ρ0, ρ1 can be for-\nmulated as the following optimization problem.\nEPPT\nC\n(ρ0, ρ1) = log min ⌈k⌉\ns.t.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWj, Qj ∈ E, j = 0, 1,\nW0 + W1 = Q0 + Q1 = I,\nTr [(ρ0 − ρ1)W0] = 1\n2∥ρ0 − ρ1∥1,\n− kQTB\nj\n≤ W TB\nj\n− QTB\nj\n≤ kQTB\nj .\n(22)\nwhere k ≥ 2. If ρ0, ρ1 can be perfectly discriminated by PPT POVMs, EPPT\nC\n(ρ0, ρ1) is set to be zero.\nNotably, the optimization problem in Eq. (22) is not a valid SDP. However, the spectral PPT-distance\nof a POVM can be a lower bound for the entanglement cost of optimal PPT-discrimination and LOCC-\ndiscrimination.\nProposition 4 Given two bipartite quantum states ρ0, ρ1 with the same prior probability, the\nentanglement costs of optimal PPT-discrimination and LOCC-discrimination satisfy\nELOCC\nC\n(ρ0, ρ1) ≥ EPPT\nC\n(ρ0, ρ1) ≥ log min⌈D∞(W )⌉\ns.t.\n\n\n\nW = {W0, W1} is a POVM,\nTr[(ρ0 − ρ1)W0] = 1\n2∥ρ0 − ρ1∥1.\n(23)\nProof By the definition of the spectral PPT-distance of a given POVM, we can write the optimization\nproblem in Eq. (23) as\nlog min ⌈k⌉\ns.t. Wj, Qj ∈ E, j = 0, 1,\nW0 + W1 = Q0 + Q1 = I,\nTr [(ρ0 − ρ1)W0] = 1\n2∥ρ0 − ρ1∥1,\nQj ∈ EPPT, −kI ≤ W TB\nj\n− QTB\nj\n≤ kI, ∀j.\n(24)\nNotice that each feasible solution for the above optimization problem is a feasible solution to the problem\nin Eq. (22) where we use the fact that −kQTB\nj\n≤ W TB\nj\n− QTB\nj\n≤ kQTB\nj , ∀j implying Qj ∈ EPPT, ∀j.\nHence we obtain the inequality in Eq. (23).\n■\nProposition 4 reveals that an optimal general entangled POVM having the minimum spectral PPT-\ndistance can be used to derive a lower bound on the entanglement cost of optimal PPT-discrimination. In\nthe following, we further present an upper bound on the entanglement cost of optimal PPT-discrimination\nfor two arbitrary quantum states.\n7\nTheorem 5 Given two bipartite quantum states ρ0, ρ1 with the same prior probability, the entan-\nglement cost of optimal PPT-discrimination satisfies\nEPPT\nC\n(ρ0, ρ1) ≤ log\nl\r\r\rMTB\n+\n− MTB\n−\n\r\r\r\n∞\nm\n,\n(25)\nwhere M+ and M− are projections onto the positive and non-positive eigenspaces of ρ0 − ρ1,\nrespectively.\nWe leave the proof in Appendix B. Notably, Theorem 5 provides an easy-to-compute upper bound\nfor the entanglement cost of optimal PPT-discrimination of a given pair of quantum states {ρ0, ρ1} with\nequal prior probability, which only relies on the spectrum properties of the given states. Consequently,\nthis upper bound can be directly determined by the ranks of ρ0 and ρ1 as the following corollary.\nCorollary 6 For two bipartite quantum states ρ0, ρ1 with Rank ρ0 = r0 ≤ r1 = Rank ρ1,\nEPPT\nC\n(ρ0, ρ1) ≤ log η,\n(26)\nwhere η = max{2r0 − 1, r0 + 1}.\nRemark 1 We remark there is an intriguing connection between the entanglement cost of optimal PPT-\ndiscrimination and quantum data hiding [35]. Quantum data hiding demonstrates the existence of bipar-\ntite state pairs optimally distinguishable by general entangled POVMs but not by locally constrained sets\nof measurements, e.g., LOCC, SEP, and PPT POVMs. This underscores a discernible gap in the efficacy\nof message decoding when encoded in pairs of states and the receiver is constrained to limited classes\nof POVMs. These can be understood by the data-hiding procedures depending on the given physical\nsetting, e.g., two quantum devices for decoding information cannot generate reliable entanglement. For\nquantum data hiding associated with PPT POVMs, the data hiding ratio [26] against PPT POVMs is\ngiven by\nR(PPT) =\nmax\n{ρ0,ρ1,p}\n∥pρ0 − (1 − p)ρ1∥ALL\n∥pρ0 − (1 − p)ρ1∥PPT\n,\n(27)\nwhich quantifies the disparity between the capabilities of global POVMs and PPT POVMs in QSD. We\nshowcase that the strategic use of maximally entangled states in QSD tasks serves as a key to unveiling\nthese distinctions in message decoding capabilities between general entangled measurements and PPT\nPOVMs. In particular, Ref. [18] establishes a lower bound for R(PPT) with R(PPT) ≥ (d + 1)/2\nconsidering a bipartite system Hd ⊗ Hd. Subsequently, Corollary 6 shows that, in a worst case, 2+log d\nebits suffice to fully unlock the encoded information.\nIn the following, we shall show that when one of the states in {ρ0, ρ1} is pure, a single Bell state suf-\nfices to fully unlock the quantum data hiding against PPT POVMs, i.e., the optimal PPT-discrimination\ncan always be achieved with the assistance of 1 ebit.\nProposition 7 For bipartite quantum states ρ0 and ρ1, if one of them is a pure state, then\nEPPT\nC\n(ρ0, ρ1) ≤ 1.\n(28)\nProof Without loss of generality, suppose ρ0 is a pure state. According to Lemma S2, we have that the\nprojection M+ onto the positive eigenspace of ρ0 − ρ1 satisfies Rank M+ = 1. By Corollary 6, we have\nthe optimal discrimination can be achieved with EPPT\nC\n(ρ0, ρ1) = 1.\n■\nProposition 7 establishes that any d-dimensional pure state can be optimally discriminated against\nany other state with the assistance of one Bell state. This result recovers and extends the previous\nresult that one Bell state is enough for discriminating any d-dimensional pure state and its orthogonal\ncomplement [21]. Intriguingly, we observe that a single Bell state is not always enough for optimally\ndiscriminating an arbitrary pair of quantum states by PPT POVMs or LOCC.\n8\nProposition 8 There exists a pair of bipartite states {ρ, σ} for which the optimal discrimination con-\ncerning general entangled POVMs is not achievable by LOCC with the assistance of a single Bell state.\nThis phenomenon is illustrated through a numerical example provided in Appendix D, wherein we\nshowcase a pair of two-qutrit quantum states that, even with the aid of a single Bell state, cannot be\noptimally discriminated by PPT POVMs. A detailed proof is deferred to Appendix D. Moreover, we\nnote that when two states are orthogonal mixed states, the optimal PPT-discrimination can be achieved\nwith the assistance of log(d − 1) ebits.\nProposition 9 For any two orthogonal d-dimensional mixed bipartite quantum states ρ0 and ρ1,\nEPPT\nC\n(ρ0, ρ1) ≤ log(d − 1).\n(29)\nProof Denote the rank of ρ0, ρ1 as Rank ρ0 = r0 and Rank ρ1 = r1, respectively. Since ρ0 and ρ1\nare mutually orthogonal, we have r0 + r1 ≤ d. Suppose that r0 ≤ r1, we have that max r0 = d/2.\nAccording to Corollary 6, we can conclude that EPPT\nC\n(ρ0, ρ1) ≤ log(d − 1).\n■\n5\nDiscussion\nIn this work, we delve into quantifying the entanglement cost for optimally discriminating bipartite quan-\ntum states under locality constraints. We introduce the spectral PPT-distance of a POVM and utilize it to\nderive a lower bound on the entanglement cost of optimal discrimination by PPT POVMs. Furthermore,\nwe provide an upper bound based on the spectrum properties of the given states and apply it to extend the\nprevious results on discriminating a pure state against another one. Notably, our results underscore that\n2 + log d ebits are enough to unlock the quantum data hiding against PPT POVMs in a bipartite system\nHd ⊗ Hd. If the data encoding involves a pure state, then a single Bell state is sufficient.\nAn intriguing direction for future research lies in further analysis of quantum resource manipula-\ntion for state discrimination, e.g., within the framework of resource theories of coherence and magic\nstates. Specifically, the study of constrained families of POVMs, such as incoherent POVMs [36] and\nthose with positive Wigner functions [37], presents a promising avenue.

Since k ≥ 0 and QTB\nAB ≥ 0, we can\nrestrict the constraint (−k + 1)QTB\nAB ≤ W TB\nAB ≤ (k + 1)QTB\nAB as\n0 ≤ W TB\nAB ≤ (k + 1)QTB\nAB,\n(C.5)\nwhere this restriction requires k ≥ 1. And the constraint (k + 1)QTB\nAB − kIAB ≤ W TB\nAB ≤ −(k −\n1)QTB\nAB + kIAB can be restricted to\n(k + 1)QTB\nAB − kIAB ≤ W TB\nAB ≤ −(k + 1)QTB\nAB + kIAB.\n(C.6)\nIntroducing a new variable ˆQAB = (k + 1)QAB, we have the SDP upper bound.\n■\nσ =\n\n\n0.0601\n0.0327\n−0.0601\n−0.0068\n−0.0024\n−0.0040\n−0.0665\n−0.0261\n−0.0286\n0.0327\n0.0990\n−0.0789\n0.0068\n−0.0522\n−0.0660\n−0.0272\n0.0309\n−0.0397\n−0.0601\n−0.0789\n0.1812\n−0.0067\n0.0497\n0.0254\n0.0548\n0.0620\n0.0628\n−0.0068\n0.0068\n−0.0067\n0.0141\n0.0108\n−0.0137\n0.0229\n0.0277\n0.0164\n−0.0024\n−0.0522\n0.0497\n0.0108\n0.1078\n−0.0278\n−0.0031\n−0.0218\n0.0075\n−0.0040\n−0.0660\n0.0254\n−0.0137\n−0.0278\n0.1253\n0.0173\n−0.0002\n0.0593\n−0.0665\n−0.0272\n0.0548\n0.0229\n−0.0031\n0.0173\n0.1195\n0.0973\n0.0587\n−0.0261\n0.0309\n0.0620\n0.0277\n−0.0218\n−0.0002\n0.0973\n0.1906\n0.0840\n−0.0286\n−0.0397\n0.0628\n0.0164\n0.0075\n0.0593\n0.0587\n0.0840\n0.1025\n\n\n(C.7)\nD\nQutrit States Example\nProposition 8 There exists a pair of bipartite states {ρ, σ} for which the optimal discrimination con-\ncerning general entangled POVMs is not achievable by LOCC with the assistance of a single Bell state.\n16\nProof Consider the following bipartite qutrit state\nρ = 1\n5(a0|01⟩ + a1|02⟩ + a2|20⟩) + 4\n5(a0|10⟩ + a1|21⟩ + a2|12⟩),\n(D.1)\nwhere a0 =\n√\n5\n5 , a1 = 3\n√\n5\n10 and a3 = 1\n2\nq\n7\n5, and a bipartite state σ as shown in Eq. (C.7).\nFor ρ and σ, we computed the dual SDP in Eq. (13) and primal SDP in Eq. (2) using CVX [43,44]\nin Matlab [45]. Then borrowing the idea of computer-assisted proofs given in Ref. [46], we construct\nstrictly feasible solutions for SDPs associated with {ρ, σ} and {ρ ⊗ Φ+\n2 , σ ⊗ Φ+\n2 }. Consequently, we\nobtain\nP PPT\nsuc,e(ρ, σ; 2) ≤ 0.9125 < 0.9135 ≤ Psuc(ρ, σ; 2),\n(D.2)\nwhere the first inequality is indicated by the fact that the dual SDP in Eq. (13) is a minimization problem\nand the last inequality is indicated by the fact that the primal SDP in Eq. (2) is a maximization problem.\nTherefore we could conclude P PPT\nsuc,e(ρ, σ; 2) < Psuc(ρ, σ; 2) for this pair of states. Owing to the inclusion\nof LOCC ⊆ PPT, we have P LOCC\nsuc,e (ρ, σ; 2) < Psuc(ρ, σ; 2), implying that a single ebit does not suffice\nfor optimally discriminating ρ and σ with equal prior probability by LOCC.\n■\n17\n"
