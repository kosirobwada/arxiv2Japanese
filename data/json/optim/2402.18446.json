This paper delves into the entanglement cost for discriminating two bipartite quantum states, employing positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) with positive partial transpose (PPT) to achieve optimal success probability through general entangled measurements.

It has consistently been a crucial research direction to understand the power and limits of quantum operations that can be implemented by local operations and classical communication (LOCC), e.g., in quantum state discrimination [1–10]. In quantum state discrimination tasks, one usually performs a binary-valued positive-operator valued measure (POVM) on the received state and then decides which state it is according to the measurement outcome. Quantum state discrimination has led to fruitful applications in quantum cryptography [11–13], quantum dimension witness [14, 15] and quantum data hiding [16–18]. To understand the underlying mechanism of quantum state discrimination, various operations that encompass LOCC are further con- sidered due to its complex structure, including POVMs that are separable (SEP) [19, 20], and POVMs with positive partial transpose (PPT) [21–23]. There is a strict inclusion among them as [1], LOCC ⊆ SEP ⊆ PPT ⊆ ALL. (1) Notably, PPT POVMs enjoy a much simpler mathematical structure than LOCC and SEP as the former can be completely characterized by semidefinite programming (SDP) [24]. In particular, the distin- guishability of quantum states under a restricted family of measurements is closely related to quantum data hiding [25,26], which is originally based on the existence of pairs of bipartite states that are perfectly distinguishable with general entangled measurements yet indistinguishable by LOCC. In the context of bipartite state discrimination, the utility of a shared entangled state is paramount as it can significantly improve limited local distinguishability, potentially matching the efficacy of general entangled measure- ments. Notably, a maximally entangled state is often a universal resource for such enhancements [3,27]. This leads to a compelling and crucial question: How much entanglement at minimum do we need to unlock this quantum data hiding? Due to the complex structure of LOCC and entanglement, our understanding of the role of entangle- ment in quantum state discrimination is still limited. Currently, the entanglement cost is only known for a small number of ensembles of quantum states, with a focus on the set that contains at least one of the four Bell states. Specifically, it has been shown that Bell basis [28] and a set of three Bell states [19] can be distinguished with the assistance of 1 ebit. For quantum states with higher dimensions, Ref. [21] shows that 1 ebit suffices for discriminating a d ⊗ d pure state and its orthogonal complement perfectly by PPT POVMs. For other special cases, Ref. [29] demonstrates that 1 ebit is required for the optimal discrimination for a noisy Bell state ensemble by LOCC. In this paper, we study the entanglement cost of optimally discriminating two arbitrary quantum states by PPT POVMs, which is also the lower bound for the scenario of employing LOCC. Firstly, we introduce the spectral PPT-distance of a POVM which can be efficiently computed via SDP and characterizes the PPT-ness of a general POVM. Secondly, we formally define the entanglement cost of optimal discriminating a set of states via measurements under locality constraints. We show that the spectral PPT-distance of a POVM can be utilized to derive a lower bound on the entanglement cost of optimal discrimination by PPT POVMs. Thirdly, we provide an upper bound on the entanglement cost of optimal discrimination by PPT POVMs which is directly determined by the spectrum properties of the given states. Leveraging this upper bound, we show that a pure state can be optimally discriminated against any other state with the assistance of 1 ebit. 2 Preliminaries Notations. We use A and B to denote finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces HA and HB associated with the systems of Alice and Bob, respectively. The dimensions of HA and HB are denoted as dA and dB. A quantum state on system A is a positive semidefinite operator ρA with trace one. The support of ρA, denoted as supp(ρA), is defined as the space spanned by the eigenvectors of ρA with positive eigenvalues. Let {|j⟩}j=0,··· ,d−1 be a standard computational basis, then a standard maximally entangled 2 𝜌0, 𝜌1?

Alice and Bob (repre- sented as A and B) aim to discriminate bipartite quantum states ρ0 and ρ1. Commencing with an initial allocation of entanglement resources, the optimal discrimination achievable through a general entangled measurement is demonstrated to be attainable by employing measurements under locality constraints, showcasing the pivotal role of entanglement consumption in the discrimination process. state of Schmidt rank d is Φ+ d = 1/d Pd−1 i,j=0 |ii⟩⟨jj|. A bipartite quantum state ρAB is said to be Positive- Partial-Transpose (PPT) if ρTB AB ≥ 0 where TB denotes taking partial transpose on the subsystem B. Quantum State Discrimination. Quantum measurements are described by positive-operator-valued- measure (POVM). A POVM with n elements is denoted as E = {Ej}n−1 j=0 where Ej ≥ 0 and P j Ej = I. Suppose Ω = {(pj, ρj)}n−1 j=0 is an ensemble of n quantum states ρ0 . . . ρn−1 given with associated probability p0 . . . pn−1. In the task of quantum state discrimination, we usually apply a POVM on a given unknown state ρj with prior probability pj and decide which state it is according to the measurement outcomes. In the context of minimum-error state discrimination (MSD), the goal is to maximize the average success probability, given by Psuc(Ω) = max {Ej} n−1 X j=0 pj Tr(ρjEj). (2) Notably, the celebrated result in Ref. [30] shows that optimal discrimination success probability of dis- criminating two quantum states {ρ0, ρ1} with prior probability p0 and p1 is given by 1 2(1 + ∥p0ρ0 − p1ρ1∥1), where ∥·∥1 denotes the trace norm. The corresponding POVM is called the Helstrom measure- ments. It can be expressed by M+ and M−, where M+ is the projection on the positive eigenspace of p0ρ0 − p1ρ1 and M− = I − M+. We denote E(HA) as the set of all positive semidefinite Hermitian matrices on HA that satisfy 0 ≤ E ≤ I, ∀E ∈ E(HA). It is easy to see that E(HA) is a convex set and we will use the notation E as a shorthand for E(HA) when there is no ambiguity for the Hilbert space. Considering POVMs under locality constraints acting on a bipartite system AB, we denote ELOCC as the set of all elements of LOCC POVMs [31] which includes strategies based on measurement outcomes performed locally on each subsystem. We denote ESEP(HA ⊗ HB) := ( E(k) A ⊗ E(k) B : E(k) A ≥ 0, E(k) B ≥ 0, X k E(k) A ⊗ E(k) B = I ) (3) as the set of all elements for SEP POVMs [32] and EPPT(HA ⊗ HB) := n EAB : 0 ≤ EAB ≤ IAB, 0 ≤ ETB AB ≤ IAB o (4) as the set of all elements for PPT POVMs [32]. 3 3 Spectral PPT-distance of a POVM To investigate the capability of measurements under locality constraints, we first focus on the charac- terization of the localness of a POVM. In light of the favorable mathematical characterization of PPT POVMs, we introduce the generalized PPT-distance of a POVM as follows. Definition 1 (Generalized PPT-distance) Given a POVM M = {Mj}n−1 j=0 acting on a bipartite system HA ⊗ HB, its generalized PPT-distance is defined as D(M) = min \u001a r \f\f\f\f ∆(MTB j , ETB j ) ≤ r, n−1 X j=0 Ej = I, Ej ∈ EPPT, ∀j \u001b , (5) where ∆(·, ·) is a metric that satisfies positive-definiteness, symmetry, and triangle inequality. The mini- mization ranges over all possible {Ej}j. Particularly, an essential metric is the distance induced by the Schatten p-norms, i.e., ∥X∥p = \u0010 Tr h (X†X) p 2 i\u0011 1 p , p ∈ [1, ∞). (6) This family includes the three most commonly used distances in quantum information theory, i.e., the trace distance, the Frobenius distance, and the spectral distance. The Schatten-p PPT-distance is denoted as Dp(M) for ∆(MTB j , ETB j ) := ∥MTB j −ETB j ∥p. Its geometric interpretation is depicted in Fig. 2. For p = ∞ where ∥ · ∥∞ corresponds to a fundamentally important norm of the spectral norm, we have the spectral PPT-distance of a POVM as follows. Definition 2 (Spectral PPT-distance) Given a POVM M = {Mj}n−1 j=0 acting on a bipartite system HA ⊗ HB, its spectral PPT-distance is defined as D∞(M) = min \u001a r \f\f\f\f \r\r\rMTB j − ETB j \r\r\r ∞ ≤ r, n−1 X j=0 Ej = I, Ej ∈ EPPT, ∀j \u001b , (7) where the minimization ranges over all possible {Ej}j. The spectral PPT-distance of a POVM bears nice properties. Firstly, it is efficiently computable via SDP and quantifies the proximity of a given POVM to the set of PPT POVMs. Specifically, D∞(M) is faithful, i.e., D∞(M) ≥ 0 and D∞(M) = 0 if and only if M is a PPT POVM. Secondly, it is invariant under local unitaries which is directly obtained by the local unitary invariance of the spectral norm and PPT-ness of Ej. Thirdly, for two POVMs M0 = {M0,j}n−1 j=0 and M1 = {M1,j}n−1 j=0 , we denote a convex combination of them as c M = αM0 + (1 − α)M1 := { c Mj}n−1 j=0 where c Mj = αM0,j + (1 − α)M1,j; denote the tensor product of them as f M = M0 ⊗ M1 := {f Mjk}n−1 j,k=0 where f Mjk = M0,j ⊗ M1,k. We show that D∞(M) is convex w.r.t. the convex combination and linearly subadditive w.r.t. the tensor product of POVMs. Proposition 1 (Convexity) For POVMs M0, M1 acting on a bipartite system HA⊗HB and 0 ≤ α ≤ 1, D∞(αM0 + (1 − α)M1) ≤ α · D∞(M0) + (1 − α) · D∞(M1). (8) Proposition 2 (Linearly subadditivity) For POVMs M0 = {M0,j}j, M1 = {M1,k}k acting on a bipartite system HA ⊗ HB, D∞(M0 ⊗ M1) ≤ ξ · D∞(M0) + ζ · D∞(M1), (9) where ξ = maxk(1 + ∥MTB 1,k ∥∞)/2 and ζ = maxj(1 + ∥MTB 0,j ∥∞)/2. 4 𝑀 𝑀𝑇𝐵 𝑘1 𝐼 − 𝑀 𝐼 − 𝑀 𝑇𝐵 𝑘2 𝐼 − 𝐸 𝐸 ℰPPT ℰ Fig 2: The spectral PPT-distance of a given binary-valued POVM M = {M, I − M}. It is defined as the minimum spectral distance from the partial transpose of M, I − M to the set of PPT POVMs. That is, D∞(M) = min max{k1, k2} where the minimization ranges over all possible choices of E, I − E ∈ EPPT. Each POVM is associated with a pair of points in the set, connected by a dashed line that intersects the origin point I/2. 4 Entanglement cost of PPT discrimination Now, we study the amount of entanglement required to discriminate a set of quantum states by PPT POVMs optimally. Herein, optimality refers to achieving the maximal average success probability with- out any restrictions on POVMs. We note the spectral PPT-distance of a POVM provides insights into the minimum amount of entanglement required to promote a PPT POVM to the given POVM. We will demonstrate this aspect through its application in quantum state discrimination tasks in the following. Recall the optimal average success probability of discriminating two quantum states is given by Eq. (2) when there are no restrictions on the POVM one is allowed to perform. However, an inher- ent challenge that arises in practice is the spatial distribution of quantum facilities, leading to the con- straint that each laboratory can execute local quantum operations with mutual classical communication available. This motivates us to consider POVMs under locality constraints, including LOCC POVMs, SEP POVMs, and PPT POVMs as illustrated in Eq. (1). Despite extensive research characterizing the minimum amount of entanglement required to discriminate quantum states by POVMs under locality constraints [19, 21, 29, 33, 34], a quantitative analysis is still lacking. To address this problem, we first introduce the entanglement-assisted average success probability where two parties are allowed to share entanglement to assist their QSD tasks. Definition 3 (Entanglement-assisted average success probability) Given a quantum state ensemble Ω = {(pj, ρj)}n−1 j=0 , where pj ≥ 0 and P j pj = 1, and a positive integer k ≥ 2, the entanglement- assisted average success probability of discriminating Ω via operation class Π is defined as P Π suc,e(Ω; k) = max {Ej}∈Π n−1 X j=0 pj Tr[Ej(ρj ⊗ Φ+ k )], (10) where {Ej}n−1 j=0 is a POVM, Π ∈ {LOCC, SEP, PPT}. We also denote P Π suc(Ω) as the optimal average success probability when using POVMs in Π. Then it is natural to formally define the entanglement cost of optimal Π-discrimination by considering how much entanglement it needs to render this entanglement-assisted average success probability identical to the original optimal success probability with no restrictions on POVMs. Definition 4 (Entanglement cost of optimal Π-discrimination) Given a quantum state ensemble Ω = {(pj, ρj)}n−1 j=0 , where pj ≥ 0 and P j pj = 1, the entanglement cost of optimal Π-discrimination is defined as EΠ C(Ω) = min \b log k : P Π suc,e(Ω; k) = Psuc(Ω), k ≥ 2 \t . (11) If P Π suc(Ω) = Psuc(Ω), then EΠ C(Ω) is set to be zero. 5 Throughout the paper, we take the logarithm to be base two unless stated otherwise. In particular, con- sider the scenario of discriminating a pair of quantum states ρ0 and ρ1 given with the same prior proba- bility as the results for asymmetric probabilities can be easily generalized. We write the entanglement- assisted average success probability of discriminating ρ0 and ρ1 by PPT POVMs as P PPT suc,e(ρ0, ρ1; k) and establish its SDP form in the following Proposition 3. The derivation of its dual form can be found in Appendix A. Proposition 3 Given two bipartite quantum states ρ0, ρ1 with the same prior probability, the entanglement-assisted average success probability of PPT-discrimination is P PPT suc,e(ρ0, ρ1; k) = max Wi,Qi 1 2 Tr(ρ0W0 + ρ1W1) s.t.      Wj, Qj ∈ E, j = 0, 1, W0 + W1 = Q0 + Q1 = I, − kQTB j ≤ W TB j − QTB j ≤ kQTB j . (12) Proof By definition, the entanglement-assisted average success probability by PPT POVMs can be computed via the following SDP, P PPT suc,e(ρ0, ρ1; k) = max 1 2 + 1 2 Tr h E[(ρ0 − ρ1) ⊗ Φ+ k ] i s.t. 0 ≤ ETBB′ ≤ I, (13) 0 ≤ E ≤ I, where Φ+ k is the maximally entangled state on HA′ ⊗ HB′ with dA′ = dB′ = k. To further simplify the optimization problem, we notice that we can write Tr[E((ρ0 − ρ1) ⊗ Φ+ k )] = Tr[(ρ0 − ρ1) TrA′B′((IAB ⊗ Φ+ k )E)]. (14) Suppose eE is an optimal solution. Since Φ+ k is invariant under any local unitary UA′ ⊗ U ∗ B′, i.e., (UA′ ⊗ U ∗ B′)Φ+ k (UA′ ⊗ U ∗ B′)† = Φ+ k , (UA′ ⊗ U ∗ B′)E(UA′ ⊗ U ∗ B′)† is also an optimal solution. Since any convex combination of optimal solutions remains optimal, we have that Z dU(UA′ ⊗ U ∗ B′)E(UA′ ⊗ U ∗ B′)† (15) is optimal, where dU is the Haar measure. Then according to Schur’s lemma, we can restrict the optimal eE as eE = WAB ⊗ Φ+ k + QAB ⊗ (I − Φ+ k ), (16) with certain linear operators WAB and QAB. It follows that TrA′B′[(IAB ⊗ Φ+ k ) eE] = TrA′B′[(IAB ⊗ Φ+ k )(WAB ⊗ Φ+ k + QAB ⊗ (I − Φ+ k ))] = WAB, (17) which can simplify the objective function as Tr \u0002 (ρ0 − ρ1) ⊗ Φ+ k \u0003 = Tr [(ρ0 − ρ1)WAB] . (18) By spectral decomposition, we have (Φ+ k )TB = (P+ − P−) /k, where P+ and P− are the symmetric and anti-symmetric projections respectively. Then it follows that eETBB′ = W TB AB ⊗ (Φ+ k )TB′ + QTB AB ⊗ \u0000I − Φ+ k \u0001TB′ = W TB AB ⊗ P+ − P− k + QTB AB ⊗ (k − 1)P+ + (k + 1)P− k = h W TB AB + (k − 1)QTB AB i ⊗ P+ k + h −W TB AB + (k + 1)QTB AB i ⊗ P− k . (19) 6 Since P+ and P− are positive and orthogonal to each other, we have 0 ≤ eETBB′ ≤ I if and only if 0 ≤ W TB AB + (k − 1)QTB AB ≤ kIAB, 0 ≤ −W TB AB + (k + 1)QTB AB ≤ kIAB. (20) Similarly, we have 0 ≤ eE ≤ I if and only if 0 ≤ WAB ≤ IAB, 0 ≤ QAB ≤ IAB (21) Combining equations (20) and (21), the entanglement cost of optimal PPT-discrimination can be simpli- fied and calculated by the optimization problem. ■ Based on Proposition 3, the entanglement cost of optimal PPT-discrimination of ρ0, ρ1 can be for- mulated as the following optimization problem. EPPT C (ρ0, ρ1) = log min ⌈k⌉ s.t.              Wj, Qj ∈ E, j = 0, 1, W0 + W1 = Q0 + Q1 = I, Tr [(ρ0 − ρ1)W0] = 1 2∥ρ0 − ρ1∥1, − kQTB j ≤ W TB j − QTB j ≤ kQTB j . (22) where k ≥ 2. If ρ0, ρ1 can be perfectly discriminated by PPT POVMs, EPPT C (ρ0, ρ1) is set to be zero. Notably, the optimization problem in Eq. (22) is not a valid SDP. However, the spectral PPT-distance of a POVM can be a lower bound for the entanglement cost of optimal PPT-discrimination and LOCC- discrimination. Proposition 4 Given two bipartite quantum states ρ0, ρ1 with the same prior probability, the entanglement costs of optimal PPT-discrimination and LOCC-discrimination satisfy ELOCC C (ρ0, ρ1) ≥ EPPT C (ρ0, ρ1) ≥ log min⌈D∞(W )⌉ s.t.    W = {W0, W1} is a POVM, Tr[(ρ0 − ρ1)W0] = 1 2∥ρ0 − ρ1∥1. (23) Proof By the definition of the spectral PPT-distance of a given POVM, we can write the optimization problem in Eq. (23) as log min ⌈k⌉ s.t. Wj, Qj ∈ E, j = 0, 1, W0 + W1 = Q0 + Q1 = I, Tr [(ρ0 − ρ1)W0] = 1 2∥ρ0 − ρ1∥1, Qj ∈ EPPT, −kI ≤ W TB j − QTB j ≤ kI, ∀j. (24) Notice that each feasible solution for the above optimization problem is a feasible solution to the problem in Eq. (22) where we use the fact that −kQTB j ≤ W TB j − QTB j ≤ kQTB j , ∀j implying Qj ∈ EPPT, ∀j. Hence we obtain the inequality in Eq. (23). ■ Proposition 4 reveals that an optimal general entangled POVM having the minimum spectral PPT- distance can be used to derive a lower bound on the entanglement cost of optimal PPT-discrimination. In the following, we further present an upper bound on the entanglement cost of optimal PPT-discrimination for two arbitrary quantum states. 7 Theorem 5 Given two bipartite quantum states ρ0, ρ1 with the same prior probability, the entan- glement cost of optimal PPT-discrimination satisfies EPPT C (ρ0, ρ1) ≤ log l\r\r\rMTB + − MTB − \r\r\r ∞ m , (25) where M+ and M− are projections onto the positive and non-positive eigenspaces of ρ0 − ρ1, respectively. We leave the proof in Appendix B. Notably, Theorem 5 provides an easy-to-compute upper bound for the entanglement cost of optimal PPT-discrimination of a given pair of quantum states {ρ0, ρ1} with equal prior probability, which only relies on the spectrum properties of the given states. Consequently, this upper bound can be directly determined by the ranks of ρ0 and ρ1 as the following corollary. Corollary 6 For two bipartite quantum states ρ0, ρ1 with Rank ρ0 = r0 ≤ r1 = Rank ρ1, EPPT C (ρ0, ρ1) ≤ log η, (26) where η = max{2r0 − 1, r0 + 1}. Remark 1 We remark there is an intriguing connection between the entanglement cost of optimal PPT- discrimination and quantum data hiding [35]. Quantum data hiding demonstrates the existence of bipar- tite state pairs optimally distinguishable by general entangled POVMs but not by locally constrained sets of measurements, e.g., LOCC, SEP, and PPT POVMs. This underscores a discernible gap in the efficacy of message decoding when encoded in pairs of states and the receiver is constrained to limited classes of POVMs. These can be understood by the data-hiding procedures depending on the given physical setting, e.g., two quantum devices for decoding information cannot generate reliable entanglement. For quantum data hiding associated with PPT POVMs, the data hiding ratio [26] against PPT POVMs is given by R(PPT) = max {ρ0,ρ1,p} ∥pρ0 − (1 − p)ρ1∥ALL ∥pρ0 − (1 − p)ρ1∥PPT , (27) which quantifies the disparity between the capabilities of global POVMs and PPT POVMs in QSD. We showcase that the strategic use of maximally entangled states in QSD tasks serves as a key to unveiling these distinctions in message decoding capabilities between general entangled measurements and PPT POVMs. In particular, Ref. [18] establishes a lower bound for R(PPT) with R(PPT) ≥ (d + 1)/2 considering a bipartite system Hd ⊗ Hd. Subsequently, Corollary 6 shows that, in a worst case, 2+log d ebits suffice to fully unlock the encoded information. In the following, we shall show that when one of the states in {ρ0, ρ1} is pure, a single Bell state suf- fices to fully unlock the quantum data hiding against PPT POVMs, i.e., the optimal PPT-discrimination can always be achieved with the assistance of 1 ebit. Proposition 7 For bipartite quantum states ρ0 and ρ1, if one of them is a pure state, then EPPT C (ρ0, ρ1) ≤ 1. (28) Proof Without loss of generality, suppose ρ0 is a pure state. According to Lemma S2, we have that the projection M+ onto the positive eigenspace of ρ0 − ρ1 satisfies Rank M+ = 1. By Corollary 6, we have the optimal discrimination can be achieved with EPPT C (ρ0, ρ1) = 1. ■ Proposition 7 establishes that any d-dimensional pure state can be optimally discriminated against any other state with the assistance of one Bell state. This result recovers and extends the previous result that one Bell state is enough for discriminating any d-dimensional pure state and its orthogonal complement [21]. Intriguingly, we observe that a single Bell state is not always enough for optimally discriminating an arbitrary pair of quantum states by PPT POVMs or LOCC. 8 Proposition 8 There exists a pair of bipartite states {ρ, σ} for which the optimal discrimination con- cerning general entangled POVMs is not achievable by LOCC with the assistance of a single Bell state. This phenomenon is illustrated through a numerical example provided in Appendix D, wherein we showcase a pair of two-qutrit quantum states that, even with the aid of a single Bell state, cannot be optimally discriminated by PPT POVMs. A detailed proof is deferred to Appendix D. Moreover, we note that when two states are orthogonal mixed states, the optimal PPT-discrimination can be achieved with the assistance of log(d − 1) ebits. Proposition 9 For any two orthogonal d-dimensional mixed bipartite quantum states ρ0 and ρ1, EPPT C (ρ0, ρ1) ≤ log(d − 1). (29) Proof Denote the rank of ρ0, ρ1 as Rank ρ0 = r0 and Rank ρ1 = r1, respectively. Since ρ0 and ρ1 are mutually orthogonal, we have r0 + r1 ≤ d. Suppose that r0 ≤ r1, we have that max r0 = d/2. According to Corollary 6, we can conclude that EPPT C (ρ0, ρ1) ≤ log(d − 1). ■ 5 Discussion In this work, we delve into quantifying the entanglement cost for optimally discriminating bipartite quan- tum states under locality constraints. We introduce the spectral PPT-distance of a POVM and utilize it to derive a lower bound on the entanglement cost of optimal discrimination by PPT POVMs. Furthermore, we provide an upper bound based on the spectrum properties of the given states and apply it to extend the previous results on discriminating a pure state against another one. Notably, our results underscore that 2 + log d ebits are enough to unlock the quantum data hiding against PPT POVMs in a bipartite system Hd ⊗ Hd. If the data encoding involves a pure state, then a single Bell state is sufficient. An intriguing direction for future research lies in further analysis of quantum resource manipula- tion for state discrimination, e.g., within the framework of resource theories of coherence and magic states. Specifically, the study of constrained families of POVMs, such as incoherent POVMs [36] and those with positive Wigner functions [37], presents a promising avenue. Additionally, the exploration of resource manipulation in quantum state discrimination, with respect to thermodynamics [38,39] and imaginarity [40], could pave the way for novel insights into the interplay between quantum resources and measurement processes.

By introducing the Lagrange multiplier A, C, D, F,G,H, the Lagrange function of the primal problem is L(A, B, C, D, F, G) = 1 2 + 1 2 Tr[(ρ0 − ρ1)W] − ⟨A, W − I⟩ − ⟨B, Q − I⟩ − ⟨C, (1 − k)QTB − W TB⟩ − ⟨D, W TB − (1 + k)QTB⟩ − ⟨F, (1 + k)QTB − kI − W TB⟩ − ⟨G, W TB − kI + (k − 1)QTB⟩ = 1 2 + 1 2 Tr[(ρ0 − ρ1)W] − ⟨A, W⟩ + ⟨A⟩ − ⟨B, Q⟩ + ⟨B⟩ − ⟨C, (1 − k)QTB⟩ + ⟨C, W TB⟩ − ⟨D, W TB⟩ + ⟨D, (1 + k)QTB⟩ − ⟨F, (1 + k)QTB⟩ + ⟨F, kI⟩ + ⟨F, W TB⟩ − ⟨G, W TB⟩ + ⟨G, kI⟩ − ⟨G, (k − 1)QTB⟩ = 1 2 + Tr[A] + Tr[B] + Tr[kF] + Tr[kG] + 1 2⟨(ρ0 − ρ1), W⟩ − ⟨A, W⟩ + ⟨CTB, W⟩ − ⟨DTB, W⟩ + ⟨F TB, W⟩ − ⟨GTB, W⟩ − ⟨B, Q⟩ − ⟨(1 − k)CTB, Q⟩ + ⟨(1 + k)DTB, Q⟩ − ⟨(1 + k)F TB, Q⟩ − ⟨(k − 1)GTB, Q⟩. The corresponding Lagrange dual function is g(A, B, C, D, F, G) = inf W≥0,Q≥0 L(W, Q, A, B, C, D, F, G). (A.1) Since W ≥ 0 and Q ≥ 0, it must hold that 1 2(ρ0 − ρ1) − A + CTB − DTB + F TB − GTB ≤ 0 (A.2a) − B − (1 − k)CTB + (1 + k)DTB − (1 + k)F TB − (k − 1)GTB ≤ 0. (A.2b) Thus the dual SDP is P PPT suc,e(ρ0, ρ1; k) = min 1 2 + Tr[A + B] + k Tr[F + G] s.t. 1 2(ρ0 − ρ1) − A + CTB − DTB + F TB − GTB ≤ 0 − B − (1 − k)CTB + (1 + k)DTB − (1 + k)F TB − (k − 1)GTB ≤ 0. (A.3) B Proof of Theorems Proposition 1 (Convexity) For POVMs M0, M1 acting on a bipartite system HA⊗HB and 0 ≤ α ≤ 1, D∞(αM0 + (1 − α)M1) ≤ αD∞(M0) + (1 − α)D∞(M1). (B.1) Proof Denote the optimal POVMs for D∞(M0) and D∞(M1) are {Sj}j and {Tj}j, respectively. {αSj + (1 − α)Tj}j is a valid POVM as well. Then we have D∞(M) ≤ max j ∥αMTB 0,j + (1 − α)MTB 1,j − αSTB j − (1 − α)T TB j ∥∞. (B.2) Notice that ∥αMTB 0,j + (1 − α)MTB 1,j − αSTB j − (1 − α)T TB j ∥∞ ≤∥α(MTB 0,j − STB j ) + (1 − α)(MTB 1,j − T TB j )∥∞ ≤α∥MTB 0,j − STB j ∥∞ + (1 − α)∥MTB 1,j − T TB j ∥∞ ≤αD∞(M0) + (1 − α)D∞(M1). (B.3) Hence, we complete the proof. ■ 13 Proposition 2 (Linearly subadditivity) For POVMs M0, M1 acting on a bipartite system HA ⊗ HB, D∞(M0 ⊗ M1) ≤ ξ · D∞(M0) + ζ · D∞(M1), (B.4) where ξ = maxk(1 + ∥MTB 1,k ∥∞)/2 and ζ = maxj(1 + ∥MTB 0,j ∥∞)/2. Proof Denote the optimal POVMs for D∞(M0) and D∞(M1) are {Sj}j and {Tj}j, respectively. Then we have D∞(M) ≤ max j,k ∥MTB 0,j ⊗ MTB′ 1,k − STB j ⊗ T TB′ k ∥∞. (B.5) Notice that ∥MTB 0,j ⊗ MTB′ 1,k − STB j ⊗ T TB′ k ∥∞ ≤∥MTB 0,j ⊗ (MTB′ 1,k − T TB′ k )∥∞ + ∥(MTB 0,j − STB j ) ⊗ T TB′ k ∥∞ ≤∥MTB 0,j ∥∞∥MTB′ 1,k − T TB′ k ∥∞ + ∥MTB 0,j − STB j ∥∞∥T TB′ k ∥∞ ≤∥MTB 0,j ∥∞D∞(M1) + D∞(M0) (B.6) Similarly, we have ∥MTB 0,j ⊗ MTB′ 1,k − STB j ⊗ T TB′ k ∥∞ ≤ ∥MTB 1,k ∥∞D∞(M0) + D∞(M1). (B.7) Combining Eq. (B.6) and Eq. (B.7), we have ∥MTB 0,j ⊗ MTB′ 1,k − STB j ⊗ T TB′ k ∥∞ ≤ 1 + ∥MTB 1,k ∥∞ 2 D∞(M0) + 1 + ∥MTB 0,j ∥∞ 2 D∞(M1). (B.8) Therefore, we have D∞(M0 ⊗ M1) ≤ ξ · D∞(M0) + ζ · D∞(M1), (B.9) where ξ = maxk(1 + ∥MTB 1,k ∥∞)/2 and ζ = maxj(1 + ∥MTB 0,j ∥∞)/2. ■ Lemma S1 (Weyl’s inequality [41]) Let A, B ∈ Mn be Hermitian and let the respective eigenvalues of A, B, and A + B be {λi(A)}n j=1 , {λi(B)}n j=1, and {λi(A + B)}n j=1, in a non-decreasing order. Then λi(A + B) ≤ λi+j(A) + λn−j(B), j = 0, 1, . . . , n − i (B.10) for each i = 1, . . . , n, with equality for some pair i, j if and only if there is a nonzero vector x such that Ax = λi+j(A)x, Bx = λn−j(B)x, and (A + B)x = λi(A + B)x. Also, λi−j+1(A) + λj(B) ≤ λi(A + B), j = 1, . . . , i (B.11) for each i = 1, . . . , n, with equality for some pair i, j if and only if there is a nonzero vector x such that Ax = λi−j+1(A)x, Bx = λj(B)x, and (A + B)x = λi(A + B)x. Lemma S2 For quantum states ρ0 and ρ1 with Rank(ρ0) = r0, Rank(ρ1) = r1, let M+ denote the projector onto the positive eigenspace of ρ0 − ρ1. It satisfies Rank(M+) ≤ min{r0, r1}. Proof Without loss of generality, we suppose 1 ≤ r0 ≤ r1 ≤ n and denote ρ0 = P j qj|ψj⟩⟨ψj|, ρ1 = P j pj|ϕj⟩⟨ϕj|, where q1 = · · · = qn−r0 = 0 ≤ qn−r0+1 ≤ · · · ≤ qn < 1, p1 ≥ · · · ≥ pr1 ≥ pr1+1 = · · · = pn = 0. (B.12) Consider the eigenvalues of ρ0 − ρ1 in a non-decreasing order as {λk(ρ0 − ρ1)}k. By Eq. (B.10) in Lemma S1, we have λn−r0(ρ0 − ρ1) ≤ qn−r0 − pn ≤ 0. (B.13) Then we can conclude that the number of positive eigenvalues of ρ0 − ρ1 is less than r0. Thus, the projector M+ onto the positive eigenspace of ρ0 − ρ1 satisfies Rank(M+) ≤ r0. ■ 14 Theorem 5 Given two bipartite quantum states ρ0, ρ1 with the same prior probability, the entanglement cost of optimal PPT-discrimination satisfies EPPT C (ρ0, ρ1) ≤ log l\r\r\rMTB + − MTB − \r\r\r ∞ m , (B.14) where M+ and M− be the projectors onto the positive and non-positive eigenspaces of ρ0 − ρ1, respec- tively. Proof Given the quantum states ρ0 and ρ1, let M+ be the projector onto the positive eigenspace of ρ0 − ρ1. We will show that if 1 − k 2 I ≤ MTB + ≤ 1 + k 2 I (B.15) satisfies for some positive integer k, {W0 = M+, Q0 = I/2, k} is a feasible solution to the optimization problem in Eq. (22). Taking Q0 = I/2 and W0 = M+ and (1−k)/2·I ≤ MTB + ≤ (1+k)/2·I, we can easily check that constraints in Eq. (22) are satisfied. Denoting M− as the projector onto the non-positive eigenspace of ρ0 − ρ1 such that M+ + M− = I, we arrange Eq. (B.15) as −kI ≤ MTB + − MTB − ≤ kI and complete the proof. ■ Corollary 6 For two bipartite quantum states ρ0, ρ1 with Rank ρ0 = r0 ≤ r1 = Rank ρ1, EPPT C (ρ0, ρ1) ≤ log η, (B.16) where η = max{2r0 − 1, r0 + 1}. Proof By Lemma S2, we have that the projector M+ onto the positive eigenspace of ρ0 − ρ1 satisfies Rank M+ ≤ r0. Suppose MTB + has a spectral decomposition MTB + = Pr0 j |ψj⟩⟨ψj|. It follows λmin(MTB + ) ≥ r0 X j λ(|ψj⟩⟨ψj|TB) ≥ r0 X j −1 2 = −1 2r0, (B.17) where the second inequality based on the result that the partial transpose of any pure state has eigenvalues between [−1/2, 1] [42], i.e. − 1 2 ≤ λmin(|ψj⟩⟨ψj|TB) ≤ λmax(|ψj⟩⟨ψj|TB) ≤ 1. Similarly, for λmax λmax(MTB + ) ≤ r0 X j λ(|ψj⟩⟨ψj|TB) ≤ r0 X j 1 = r0. (B.18) Combining inequalities in Eq. (B.17) and Eq. (B.18), we can deduce that −r0 2 I ≤ MTB + ≤ r0I. (B.19) By Theorem 5, we have EPPT C (ρ0, ρ1) ≤ log η, where η = max{2r0 − 1, r0 + 1}, ■ C Entanglement Cost of PPT discrimination Lower and Upper Bounds Proposition S3 Given quantum states ρ0 and ρ1, it satisfies that EPPT C (ρ0, ρ1) ≥ log⌈ηl⌉ where ηl = min k s.t. 0 ≤ WAB ≤ IAB, 0 ≤ ˆQAB ≤ (k + 1)IAB, 2 Tr [(ρ1 − ρ0)WAB] = ∥ρ0 − ρ1∥1, − ˆQTB AB ≤ W TB AB ≤ ˆQTB AB, (C.1) ˆQTB AB − kIAB ≤ W TB AB ≤ kIAB. 15 Proof We first find the SDP lower bound for the entanglement cost of PPT discrimination. The basic idea is to relax the constraints of the bi-linear optimization problem and introduce a new variable. Since k ≥ 0 and QTB AB ≥ 0, the constraint (−k + 1)QTB AB ≤ W TB AB ≤ (k + 1)QTB AB can be relaxed to −(k + 1)QTB AB ≤ W TB AB ≤ (k + 1)QTB AB. (C.2) And the constraint (k + 1)QTB AB − kIAB ≤ W TB AB ≤ −(k − 1)QTB AB + kIAB can be relax to (k + 1)QTB AB − kIAB ≤ W TB AB ≤ kIAB. (C.3) By introducing a new variable ˆQAB = (k + 1)QAB, we have the SDP lower bound. ■ Proposition S4 Given quantum states ρ0 and ρ1, it satisfies that EPPT C (ρ0, ρ1) ≤ EU C (ρ0, ρ1), where EU C (ρ0, ρ1) = log⌈ηu⌉ and, ηu = log min k s.t. 0 ≤ WAB ≤ IAB, 0 ≤ ˆQAB ≤ (k + 1)IAB, 2 Tr [(ρ1 − ρ0)WAB] = ∥ρ0 − ρ1∥1, 0 ≤ W TB AB ≤ ˆQTB AB, (C.4a) ˆQTB AB − kIAB ≤ W TB AB ≤ − ˆQTB AB + kIAB. Proof We then find the SDP upper bound for the entanglement cost of PPT discrimination. The key idea is to restrict the constraints of the bi-linear optimization problem. Since k ≥ 0 and QTB AB ≥ 0, we can restrict the constraint (−k + 1)QTB AB ≤ W TB AB ≤ (k + 1)QTB AB as 0 ≤ W TB AB ≤ (k + 1)QTB AB, (C.5) where this restriction requires k ≥ 1. And the constraint (k + 1)QTB AB − kIAB ≤ W TB AB ≤ −(k − 1)QTB AB + kIAB can be restricted to (k + 1)QTB AB − kIAB ≤ W TB AB ≤ −(k + 1)QTB AB + kIAB. (C.6) Introducing a new variable ˆQAB = (k + 1)QAB, we have the SDP upper bound. ■ σ =   0.0601 0.0327 −0.0601 −0.0068 −0.0024 −0.0040 −0.0665 −0.0261 −0.0286 0.0327 0.0990 −0.0789 0.0068 −0.0522 −0.0660 −0.0272 0.0309 −0.0397 −0.0601 −0.0789 0.1812 −0.0067 0.0497 0.0254 0.0548 0.0620 0.0628 −0.0068 0.0068 −0.0067 0.0141 0.0108 −0.0137 0.0229 0.0277 0.0164 −0.0024 −0.0522 0.0497 0.0108 0.1078 −0.0278 −0.0031 −0.0218 0.0075 −0.0040 −0.0660 0.0254 −0.0137 −0.0278 0.1253 0.0173 −0.0002 0.0593 −0.0665 −0.0272 0.0548 0.0229 −0.0031 0.0173 0.1195 0.0973 0.0587 −0.0261 0.0309 0.0620 0.0277 −0.0218 −0.0002 0.0973 0.1906 0.0840 −0.0286 −0.0397 0.0628 0.0164 0.0075 0.0593 0.0587 0.0840 0.1025   (C.7) D Qutrit States Example Proposition 8 There exists a pair of bipartite states {ρ, σ} for which the optimal discrimination con- cerning general entangled POVMs is not achievable by LOCC with the assistance of a single Bell state. 16 Proof Consider the following bipartite qutrit state ρ = 1 5(a0|01⟩ + a1|02⟩ + a2|20⟩) + 4 5(a0|10⟩ + a1|21⟩ + a2|12⟩), (D.1) where a0 = √ 5 5 , a1 = 3 √ 5 10 and a3 = 1 2 q 7 5, and a bipartite state σ as shown in Eq. (C.7). For ρ and σ, we computed the dual SDP in Eq. (13) and primal SDP in Eq. (2) using CVX [43,44] in Matlab [45]. Then borrowing the idea of computer-assisted proofs given in Ref. [46], we construct strictly feasible solutions for SDPs associated with {ρ, σ} and {ρ ⊗ Φ+ 2 , σ ⊗ Φ+ 2 }. Consequently, we obtain P PPT suc,e(ρ, σ; 2) ≤ 0.9125 < 0.9135 ≤ Psuc(ρ, σ; 2), (D.2) where the first inequality is indicated by the fact that the dual SDP in Eq. (13) is a minimization problem and the last inequality is indicated by the fact that the primal SDP in Eq. (2) is a maximization problem. Therefore we could conclude P PPT suc,e(ρ, σ; 2) < Psuc(ρ, σ; 2) for this pair of states. Owing to the inclusion of LOCC ⊆ PPT, we have P LOCC suc,e (ρ, σ; 2) < Psuc(ρ, σ; 2), implying that a single ebit does not suffice for optimally discriminating ρ and σ with equal prior probability by LOCC. ■ 17 "
